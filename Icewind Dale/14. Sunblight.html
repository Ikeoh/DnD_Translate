    <p>Adventurers race against time to stop @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF] from unleashing terror upon Ten-Towns.</p>
    <p>Sequestered among the crags of the Spine of the World is a grim fortress hewn out of rock. This fortress is home to @creature[Xardorok
        Sunblight|IDRotF], his two living sons, and the rest of the Sunblight duergar clan. It is a heavily defended gateway between the clan's former
        home in the Underdark and its future home in Icewind Dale. From here, Xardorok plots the destruction of Ten-Towns.</p>
    <p>Xardorok has no imagination of his own. Instead, he receives inspiration from his patron, whom he believes is Deep Duerra (the duergar god of
        conquest). Unknown to Xardorok, his warlock powers come from Asmodeus, the Lord of the Nine Hells, who enjoys impersonating other gods. It is
        Asmodeus, not Deep Duerra, who inspired @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF] to become the first duergar to leave the Underdark and carve out
        a kingdom for himself on the surface.</p>

        <p>Characters who learn of Xardorok's plot to forge a dragon of chardalyn and unleash it upon Ten-Towns might decide to launch a preemptive
            strike on Xardorok's fortress. This chapter describes the fortress of Sunblight in detail, in the event the adventurers decide to attack
            it. But the characters are in for a surprise: by the time they arrive, Xardorok has already finished his construct and set it loose,
            leaving the characters with an agonizing decision: press the attack against the duergar fortress, or intercept the dragon in Ten-Towns. If
            they choose the latter course, skip over this chapter for now and proceed with
            @UUID[JournalEntry.XoUhud6QNl1zOE58.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000014]{chapter 4}.</p>
        <p>The characters are more likely to survive an invasion of Xardorok's fortress if they are at least 4th level. Characters of lower level can
            succeed if they take frequent rests or have an edge, such as plenty of healing magic or allies to back them up.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="864"><span class="entry-title-inner">Speaker's Quest</span></h2>
            <p>If the characters lack incentive to confront Xardorok in his fortress, either because they didn't encounter his sons in
                @UUID[JournalEntry.XoUhud6QNl1zOE58.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001]{chapter 1} or because the duergar threat hasn't impacted them
                yet, you can have one of the speakers in Ten-Towns invite them to a private meeting. The speaker would know the characters by
                reputation, if nothing else. At this meeting, the speaker presents the following information:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                <p><span class="rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable no-select" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button="true"

                <p>"Invisible enemies walk among us. We have seen their boot prints in the snow, and now we know what they are: duergar. These
                    malevolent dwarves of the Underdark have infiltrated Ten-Towns in search of a rare crystal known as chardalyn. With it, they're
                    building a mighty construct that will lay waste to Ten-Towns if nothing is done to stop it.</p>
                <p>"Our militia captured one of the duergar and forced it to divulge the location of their mountain stronghold. Therein you will find
                    a duergar warlord named @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF]. He aims to conquer Icewind Dale and destroy us all. For the good of
                    Ten-Towns, will you penetrate the duergar fortress, slay this evil warlord, and destroy his terrible weapon?"</p>
                <div class="float-clear">
                    <p></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>If the characters accept this quest, the speaker provides them with a map of Icewind Dale that marks the location of the duergar
                fortress, as shown on map 2.1 (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.XoUhud6QNl1zOE58.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000012#map-2.1:-icewind-dale]{Map
                2.1 Icewind Dale}"). For the benefit of your players, you can point to the fortress's location using the poster map of Icewind Dale.
            </p>
            <p>If the characters ask to speak with the captured duergar, the speaker informs them that the duergar was put to death following the
                interrogation, to keep him escaping and warning his kin. If the characters insist on seeing the duergar, the speaker takes them to a
                cellar where the body is being kept. Any character who casts a @spell[speak with dead] spell on the dead duergar can validate the
                information that the speaker has already imparted.</p>
            <p>The speaker has little to offer the characters as recompense beyond hospitality and friendship. If the characters insist on a more
                tangible reward, the speaker scowls, apologizes for misjudging them, and lets them go about their business. Their reputation takes a
                blow if they decline to help. Regardless of the meeting's outcome, the speaker's next task is to prepare the settlement for what will
                surely be the fight of its life, in the event that Xardorok's construct attacks Ten-Towns.</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="866"><span class="entry-title-inner">Xardorok's Paranoia</span></h3>
                <p>Xardorok's obsession with chardalyn is a form of madness that has consumed the duergar warlock, to the extent that he will stop at
                    nothing to obtain all of it. Xardorok prizes chardalyn more than he loves his sons and his clan, which has alienated his closest
                    advisors and forced them to question their blind obedience to him.</p>
                <p>Prolonged contact with malevolent magic suffusing the chardalyn has made Xardorok extraordinarily paranoid. He keeps his two sons,
                    Durth and Nildar, as far away from him as possible, sending them on dangerous missions to acquire more chardalyn in and around
                    Ten-Towns, fearing that they might usurp his throne otherwise. Xardorok rewards his subjects for spying on one another and
                    uncovering plots against him. The duergar closest to him are aware of the changes in his demeanor, but they lack the courage to
                    stand up to him. A few have learned to capitalize on his paranoia, gaining Xardorok's favor by fabricating evidence of coups
                    orchestrated by their rivals.</p>

                <p>@creature[Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF], the grand dame of the Muzgardt duergar clan, has recently arrived at the fortress after
                    being invited here by Xardorok. The Muzgardts are based in Gracklstugh, a duergar city in the Underdark. They mass-produce and
                    distribute a filthy duergar ale made from mushrooms. Xardorok has been eager to take a fourth wife and has had his eye on
                    @creature[Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF] for many years. He asked Grandolpha to his fortress to give her a gift—a pseudodragon made
                    of chardalyn (a pseudo-pseudodragon, if you will)—and make her an offer she can't refuse. Once he conquers Icewind Dale, he wants
                    the Muzgardts to control the ale trade throughout his sunless surface kingdom.</p>
                <p>Grandolpha, for her part, is too canny and jaded to fall for Xardorok's blunt attempt at seduction. She has begun plotting with
                    disenfranchised advisors and warriors in his ranks to overthrow him when the moment is right. Ironically, despite his paranoia,
                    Xardorok is too blinded by his admiration for Grandolpha to foresee her treachery. In Grandolpha, the characters might find an
                    unlikely (if temporary) ally.</p>

                    Eventually, you get above the clouds and behold a sheer mountain wall rising more than a hundred feet before you. Carved high on
                    the wall are rows of arrow slits with lights burning behind them and clanking sounds issuing from them. A narrow staircase hewn

                        from between them flies a huge dragon made of dark ice. Its eyes glow with a bright golden light as it lets out a terrible

                    <p>This rectangular room has two sets of double doors, one to the north and the other to the south. A brazier of glowing-hot coals
                        stands in each corner. In the middle of the room is a low stone table, on the top of which is drawn an illustration that looks
                        something like a map.</p>

                <p>Closer inspection of the drawing reveals that it's an accurate depiction of Ten-Towns and its environs. Mounted to the top of a
                    thin iron stand on the table is a 6-inch-tall dragon figurine carved out of chardalyn—a miniature version of Xardorok's chardalyn
                    dragon, its wings outstretched. The figurine's stand is attached by an iron rod to a groove carved into the table, allowing the
                    figurine to move across the map from one settlement to another. If a lever on the west side of the table is pulled, the dragon
                    figurine "flies" over Ten-Towns on its preset course. Any character who pays close attention can discern the flight path of
                    Xardorok's chardalyn dragon (see @UUID[JournalEntry.XoUhud6QNl1zOE58.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000014]{chapter 4} for details).

                    <p>Braziers heaped with glowing-hot coals heat this chamber, which contains a large stone bed covered with soot-stained furs, its
                        head against the north wall. In a shallow niche above the bed is a bas relief of a giant, scowling duergar clenching its
                        teeth. At the foot of the bed is a flat-topped iron trunk sealed with a bulky padlock. A stone door is set into the western
                        wall.</p>

                    <p>The western door opens into a closet that Xardorok has converted into a shrine. A shelf embedded in the south wall holds a
                        2-foot-tall statuette of Deep Duerra made of chardalyn. It depicts a nude female duergar with no facial features and a spiked
                        crown atop her bald head. Stacked on smaller shelves around the statuette are seven mind flayer skulls. A character can
                        identify the depiction with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (@skill[Religion]) check. An indentation in the statuette's base
                        holds the key that unlocks the iron trunk in Xardorok's bedchamber. The characters can find the key if someone lifts the
                        statuette and looks underneath it.</p>

                    <p>Anyone other than Xardorok who touches the statuette of Deep Duerra must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 18 ([[/r
                        4d8]]) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Along with the psychic damage comes a
                        terrible sensation of having one's brain devoured by an illithid. Once this effect has occurred, the statuette can be handled
                        safely. Anyone who keeps the chardalyn statuette on their person for more than 1 hour gains a random form of indefinite
                        madness (see "@table[indefinite madness||Madness]" in the <a href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG">Dungeon

                    <p>The iron trunk is bolted to the floor. A character using thieves' tools can use an action to try to pick the lock, doing so
                        with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A @spell[knock] spell or similar magic also opens the trunk.</p>

                    <p>The trunk contains Xardorok's personal possessions (see "Treasure" below), and it is trapped. If all its contents are removed,
                        hidden springs raise the trunk's false bottom to rise slightly, at which point the stone visage above the bed opens its mouth
                        and belches a cloud of poisonous gas large enough to fill the room. The gas hangs in the air for 10 minutes, then dissipates.
                        Any creature that starts its turn in the cloud must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 ([[/r 4d10]]) poison

                        surrounded by six stone chairs. Seated in the chair facing the door is a haggard old duergar with long black hair streaked
                        with ribbons of white and fingernails like shards of iron. She is devouring a hearty buffet of cooked meats, mushrooms, and
                        strange Underdark fare. Lurking next to her is a small mechanical dragon made of a shiny black substance.</p>
                    <p>Hunched over a hot stove in the west side of the room are three duergar cooks. At the sight of you, they drop their utensils

                    Muzgardt|IDRotF] (see the accompanying stat block). The three @creature[duergar] cooks are Grandolpha's loyal bodyguards. The
                    chardalyn dragonet next to Grandolpha is a gift from Xardorok; it's a lawful evil construct that understands Draconic and Dwarvish
                    but can't speak. It otherwise has the statistics of a @creature[pseudodragon].</p>
                <p>After telling her bodyguards to stand down, Grandolpha invites the characters to join her for dinner. The main course is a cooked
                    intellect devourer, its brain-body stewing in its own juices. The characters can partake of the feast that Grandolpha's guards
                    have prepared, but the food has a thin layer of ash covering it that spoils the taste. Grandolpha doesn't seem to mind, though.
                    She also offers the characters a vile Muzgardt brew made from Underdark mushrooms, which she pours from a jug on the table before
                    her.</p>
                <p>Grandolpha has no stake in Xardorok's plot to conquer Icewind Dale and does nothing to help or hinder his efforts. If the
                    characters threaten her, she laughs at their audacity and refuses to meet their demands. If the characters ask for her help, she
                    shares the following information with them:</p>

                    <li class="rd__li ">Xardorok is capturing Underdark monsters, which he plans to unleash upon Icewind Dale. He has also captured a
                        myconid sovereign and is using its spores to reanimate corpses.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Xardorok has proposed an alliance between his clan and the Muzgardt clan. Grandolpha is entertaining
                        Xardorok's offer but hasn't agreed to anything. The mechanical pseudodragon was a gift from Xardorok, designed to win
                        Grandolpha's affection.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Given time, Grandolpha thinks she can turn most of the Sunblight duergar against Xardorok. Several of them

                    duergar forewoman (see area X25) carries the iron key to the padlock. A character with thieves' tools can use an action to try to
                    pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The check is made with disadvantage if the character must reach
                    through the gate from @UUID[.0000000000000013#x16.-northwest-cavern]{area X16} to get at the lock. A @spell[knock] spell or
                    similar magic also opens the padlock.</p>
                <p>Any attempt to breach the gate alerts the guards atop the watchtowers in the forge (areas X24–X26).</p>

                        wall. The source of the smoke and heat is a ten-foot-tall stone forge shaped like a pyramid with its peak sheared off. Ripples
                        of heat and flashes of firelight spew from the top of the forge, which emits a deep, pulsating heartbeat. A five-foot-deep
                        trough extends east from the forge, with rows of black anvils on either side of the depression.</p>
                    <p>Overlooking the forge are four twenty-foot-tall guard towers with gray-skinned dwarves standing behind their low battlements.
                        Stone stairs provide access to the tops of the two towers nearest the forge.</p>
                    <p>South of the forge is an enormous, five-foot-tall iron platform fitted with cranes and clamps, with short flights of iron
                        stairs leading to the top of the platform. Surrounding it is a clean-up crew consisting of a female duergar with a horn and
                        six hulking bipeds, their white fur stained with soot. They are tossing scraps into a cylindrical container. In the
                        twenty-foot-high ceiling above this bin is a wide, rectangular hole.</p>

                <p>This encounter area is made up of several smaller locations within sight of one another. Area X24 is the forge itself. Area X25 is
                    the iron platform where Xardorok's chardalyn dragon was assembled. Area X26 is the bottom of the shaft that the dragon uses to
                    move up and out of the fortress. In addition, four guard towers ringed by 3-foot-high stone battlements look out over the area.

                    here, he is standing atop the assembly platform (area X25), barking orders at the clean-up crew. Describe Xardorok as a
                    soot-stained, gray-bearded duergar with a jagged black crown on his brow and a spiky black gauntlet on one hand. His crown and
                    gauntlet are made of chardalyn.</p>
                <p>The clean-up crew consists of the @creature[duergar] forewoman, Thontara, and six @creature[Quaggoth||quaggoths]. Thontara carries
                    a horn that she uses as a loudspeaker; the iron key that unlocks the outer gate (area X23) is hidden inside a compartment in the
                    heel of her left boot.</p>
                <p>Three guards are stationed atop each tower—twelve @creature[duergar] in total. One guard on each tower is secretly loyal to

                    characters engage in battle with Xardorok and appear to be winning, these duergar help by attacking the other duergar on their
                    respective platforms; if Xardorok appears to be winning, these duergar stay out of the fight. The remaining duergar hurl javelins
                    at foes from atop the towers, growing to Large size and switching to their war picks if forced into melee combat.</p>

                        kept alive by magic. The forge grants the heart three-quarters cover. The heart is a Large object with AC 13, 27 hit points,
                        vulnerability to cold damage, and immunity to fire and psychic damage. The heart stops beating when reduced to 0 hit points,

                <p>After its bar is removed, each iron door pulls open to reveal a cramped cell with no furnishings.</p>
                <p>The tapping comes from the cell of a @creature[doppelganger] that was caught trying to infiltrate the fortress. This creature takes
                    the form of a scrawny human in a dirty loincloth named Pekoe Quint. "Pekoe" claims to be a trapper from Dougan's Hole and has the
                    small, malformed ears and pointy teeth typical of that town's inbred stock. Pekoe says that the duergar abducted him and asked him
                    a lot of questions about his town's defenses.</p>
                <p>The doppelganger knows the settlements of Ten-Towns well enough to pass for a Ten-Towner. Any character who doubts Pekoe's story
                    can make a Wisdom (@skill[Insight]) check; if the character's check result is higher than the doppelganger's Charisma
                    (@skill[Deception]) check result, the character senses that something is off about Pekoe but can't tell what. The doppelganger
                    tries to acquire some cold weather clothing and remains with the party until it reaches Ten-Towns. Once there, it slips away and
                    adopts a new disguise. The doppelganger won't harm the characters unless they give it reason to.</p>
                <p>The loud banging comes from an unarmed @creature[goliath warrior|IDRotF] named Kapanuk Talltree Thuunlakalaga. After becoming
                    separated from his hunting party during a blizzard, Kapanuk was ambushed by duergar and brought to the fortress for interrogation.
                    Since he knows nothing about Ten-Towns, Kapanuk was of little use to his captors.</p>
                <p>If released, Kapanuk tries to acquire some weapons and armor. He also invites the characters to return with him to Wyrmdoom Crag,
                    where his kin will give them the heroes' feast they deserve. He shows no offense if the characters decline the invitation, but if
                    they accept and are ready to leave, Kapanuk guides them through the mountains to his home (see
                    "@UUID[.0000000000000012#wyrmdoom-crag]{Wyrmdoom Crag}").</p>

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Psychic Conquest.</span></p>
                    <p>Xardorok deals an extra 5 ([[/r 1d10]]) psychic damage to any creature he hits with a weapon attack, and he regains a number of
                        hit points equal to the amount of psychic damage dealt.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (@skill[Religion]) check recognizes the statue as a depiction of Deep Duerra
                        (see the "Deep Duerra" sidebar). Dwarves have advantage on this check. The flame rising from the statue's head symbolizes Deep
                        Duerra's destructive, all-consuming mind. If a creature uses an action to extinguish this fire, Xardorok loses his Psychic
                        Conquest trait.</p>
                    <p>The creature chained to the statue's base is a @creature[mind flayer] with 9 hit points and no armor (AC 11). Klondorn, the
                        duergar priest (see area X31), has amputated its face-tentacles and removed the part of its brain that enables the mind flayer
                        to use its psionic powers. Consequently, it has no innate spellcasting abilities and no effective attacks. It retains its
                        Magic Resistance and its telepathy, however. Its challenge rating is 0 (0 XP).</p>
                    <p>The mind flayer doesn't expect sympathy from the characters and shies away from them. If the characters question it, the mind
                        flayer shares the following information with one of them telepathically:</p>
                    <ul class="rd__list">

                        <li class="rd__li ">This room is a temple dedicated to Deep Duerra, a duergar god of conquest and psionics. Xardorok comes
                            here to pray and draws strength from the statue's flame.</li>

                        use an action to try to break out of an iron maiden, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p>

                    <p><strong>Chest 1</strong> contains a dozen stoppered gourds, each holding a pint of a fiercely hot liquor made from fire lichen,
                        which grows in the Underdark. Each gourd can be sold to a tavernkeeper in Ten-Towns for 10 gp.</p>
                    <p><strong>Chest 2</strong> holds a gold mask shaped like the visage of a male drow (750 gp), lying on a bed of 350 gp.</p>

                    <p><strong>Chest 5</strong> contains a folded @item[Piwafwi (Cloak of Elvenkind)|OotA|piwafwi]—a dark spider-silk cloak made by
                        drow. This item has the properties of a @item[cloak of elvenkind] but loses its magic if it's exposed to sunlight for 1 hour

                    <p><strong>Chest 6</strong> holds an amber headdress set with three large purple pearls (2,500 gp).</p>
                    <p><strong>Chest 7</strong> contains a 2-foot-tall stone statuette of Demogorgon that weighs 50 pounds. Anyone who looks into the

        <p>The chardalyn dragon won't return to Xardorok's fortress until it has destroyed Ten-Towns (see the next chapter). If Xardorok is alive and
            his forge is intact when the dragon returns, Xardorok begins repairing it. The dragon regains [[/r 1d6]] hit points at the end of each
            hour of repair work. If Xardorok is slain or the red dragon's heart in the forge is destroyed, the chardalyn dragon can't be repaired.</p>
        <p>After returning to the fortress, the dragon remains there until such time as Xardorok needs it to cause more devastation, and certainly not
            before Xardorok's duergar scouts have assessed the damage to Ten-Towns.</p>
        <p>Xardorok's demise spells the doom of the Sunblight clan if neither of his sons are alive to take command. If @creature[Grandolpha
            Muzgardt|IDRotF] outlives Xardorok, she absorbs the remnants of the Sunblight clan into her own and has Xardorok's surviving sons
            executed. The Muzgardt clan takes over Xardorok's fortress but has no immediate designs against Ten-Towns or Icewind Dale. If the
            characters were instrumental in helping Grandolpha capture the fortress, she allows them to keep any treasures they found in the fortress
            but insists that they leave at once.</p>
        <p>If Xardorok and Grandolpha are both still alive when the characters depart the fortress, the division among the two duergar clans continues
            to deepen, but no immediate effort is made to unseat Xardorok. Grandolpha is content to bide her time, betraying Xardorok only after some
            setback leaves him weak and vulnerable.</p>
