    <p>Founded by Calishite settlers who appreciated beauty, Termalaine is widely regarded as the most picturesque town
        in Icewind Dale, spreading out from the shore of Maer Dualdon and bordered on the north and west by tall pines.
        Its buildings incorporate carvings of wizards, homunculi, tigers, and smiling djinn.</p>
    <p>For most visitors, the enchantment of the town is dispelled as soon as they feel the icy claws and teeth of the
        cold wind sweeping down from the north, shearing through their layers of clothing. Termalaine was built in the
        path of this dreadful gale, which continues well past the town to harry fishers on the southern half of the
        lake.</p>
    <p>In addition to fishers, shipbuilders, and scrimshanders, Termalaine is home to miners who harvest gemstones from
        a cavern complex set into a low hill north and east of the settlement. Their efforts are hampered by creatures
        from the Underdark that occasionally find their way up into the mine. Whenever such creatures are discovered,
        the mine is sealed off and the townsfolk wait until a band of sellswords or adventurers can be hired to clear it
        out.</p>

            <p>The fishers of Termalaine typically finish their days here, seated on benches near one of the building's
                long hearths to warm their feet while they fill their bellies with spiced chowder. Beautiful works of
                scrimshaw are hung on the walls.</p>
            <p>Vernon Braig (neutral good half-orc @creature[commoner]), the Blue Clam's owner and chef, knows some of
                the hunters and trappers in Lonelywood, and occasionally a sled comes down the north trail with a sack
                of hares or a haunch of moose, courtesy of one of Vernon's friends. On those nights, the Blue Clam's
                hearths are full of roasting meat, and the patrons stay later and sing louder, enjoying the good times
                while they last.</p>
            <p>Characters who loiter in the tavern are likely to hear a rumor or two, which you can determine by rolling

            <p><em>Inn</em></p>
            <p>The Eastside is where most visitors in town stay. What looks from the outside like separate houses turns
                out to be a single structure with rooms connected by underground passages, with cozy guest
                accommodations in the cellar.</p>
            <p>The innkeeper is Marta Peskryk (lawful good human @creature[commoner]), a willowy teenager who spends
                much of her time tending to her bedridden father, Clyde, a retired fisherman and noncombatant. As she
                performs her daily chores, Marta sings the following song to herself:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset ">

                <p>Draped in a fur-lined cloak of red,</p>
                <p>To the icy lake she fled;</p>
                <p>The wind pursued her all the same—</p>
                <p>As sure as night she's dead.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>If asked about the song, Marta recounts the following tale. Fifty years ago, a mysterious woman in a
                fur-lined red cloak stopped at the Eastside on her way to Lonelywood. Because the woman was alone and
                frightened, the innkeepers—a pair of retired adventurers who happened to be Marta's grandparents—tried
                to console her. The woman gave them a ring as payment for their hospitality. Not long afterward, a
                howling wind burst into the inn and tossed the woman about like a rag doll. The innkeepers intervened,
                giving the woman time to escape. The evil wind battered Marta's grandparents unconscious before resuming
                its hunt. That was the last anyone saw of the woman.</p>

                    <p>Marta wears the mysterious woman's ring (which she has inherited) around her neck on a chain. It
                        is a @item[ring of warmth], and Marta will part with it only if she can be convinced that it can
                        help bring an end to the wintry curse that besets Icewind Dale.</p>

        <p>The characters can pick up this quest if they start the adventure in Termalaine or shortly after they arrive
            in town. As they trudge through the streets, they see a young boy standing on a box, yelling about various
            local happenings, including the recent evacuation of workers from a nearby mine that has been overrun by
            kobolds. A reward of 50 gp is offered to anyone who can rid the mine of the pesky dragonlings.</p>
        <p>When the characters investigate, they discover that all is not what it seems. The kobold leader has been
            possessed by a ghost, and a grell has infiltrated the mine, setting the kobolds on edge. The characters can
            either try to parley with the kobolds and get them to leave the mine peacefully, or they can rid Ten-Towns
            of their presence permanently and try to deal with the grell on their own.</p>

                <p>A boy wrapped in heavy winter clothes shouts the news of the day as people pass by. When you
                    approach, the boy cries, "The gemstone mine is closed because of monsters! Speaker Masthew is
                    offering fifty gold to anyone who clears it out!"</p>
                <div class="float-clear">

            <p>If the characters express interest, Darmo tells them they can find the town speaker, Oarus Masthew, at
                the Blue Clam. The boy also has some information about the mine, including its location. He doesn't know
                much about the history or the particulars of the mine, but he knows it's important for Termalaine and
                its closing means a significant loss of income.</p>
            <p>The characters can make the half-hour trek to the mine without visiting Oarus, or they can go to the
                tavern to see the speaker. If the characters decide to ignore the quest, the mine remains closed for
                several weeks before the kobolds mysteriously vanish, enabling the miners to return. After the mine
                reopens, it isn't long before workers start disappearing one by one—victims of the grell.</p>

            <p>The town speaker, Oarus Masthew (lawful good half-orc @creature[veteran]), explains that a group of
                kobolds crept into the mine a few days ago, entering from the surface and forcing the miners to abandon
                their jobs. No one was killed, but the kobolds are too dangerous for the miners to deal with. He also
                reveals that a human miner went missing a few days before the kobolds showed up, prompting other miners
                to fear that a monster must have crawled up from the Underdark. Oarus thinks it's possible that the
                miner fell down the central shaft, which is deep enough that his body would never be found.</p>
            <p>One piece of information that Oarus fails to mention is that he ordered the town militia to clear out the
                mine three days ago. The militia refused to deal with the problem for what amounts to political reasons.
                Senior officers in cahoots with Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr of Targos are determined to oust Masthew as
                town speaker and replace him with one of their own in a special election. They're convinced that the
                closing of the mine and the resulting economic woes will turn Masthew's political supporters against
                him.</p>

                        named Scorp and Thwip, are using saws to weaken the wooden struts so that the walkway will
                        collapse if a creature weighing more than two kobolds tries to stand on it. These kobolds need
                        another day to complete their sabotage; until then, the walkway is safe.</p>

                <p>The bucket lift is used for hoisting miners and ore between levels 1 and 2. It's controlled by using
                    a crank inside the bucket or the crank on the side of the pulley system. The bucket can hold one
                    Medium creature or two Small creatures at a time. It runs from here to area M7, 15 feet farther
                    down, and back again. It takes 1 minute for the bucket to be lowered or raised.</p>

                    <p>In life, Janth Alowar was a neutral human sage who devoted himself by cataloguing the flora of
                        Icewind Dale. He and his guide were killed and decapitated by a yeti in the foothills of
                        Kelvin's Cairn two years ago, and his restless spirit has lingered. The kobolds happened upon
                        the ghost while searching for shelter during a blizzard, allowing it to possess Trex without the
                        other kobolds' knowledge.</p>

                    <p>The threadbare satchel carried by Trex once belonged to Janth. It contains clumps of moss,
                        lichen, and shrubbery gathered from the foothills of Kelvin's Cairn and the surrounding tundra.
                        None of the samples are valuable, but the ghost is very possessive of the collection and won't
                        give up its satchel without a fight.</p>
                    <p>Janth's ghost can be laid to rest by destroying the satchel—its last connection to the Material
                        Plane. The ghost otherwise remains as close to the satchel as possible. If the satchel is taken
                        from Trex and discarded, the ghost forsakes its current host and remains near the satchel,
                        hoping to possess someone else.</p>
                    <p>If Trex is killed, the ghost appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the kobold's body.
                        On its next turn, the ghost tries to possess one of the characters—preferably one who can take

                    <p>A fossilized skull partially juts out of the east wall of this small cave, five feet off the
                        ground. The skull has larger than normal eye sockets, a curious ridge between the eyes, nothing
                        that would pass for a nose, and four small holes where one would expect to see teeth.</p>

                <p>The skull embedded in the wall is that of a mind flayer that came up from the Underdark thousands of
                    years ago. How it became lodged in the stone is anyone's guess. Any character who examines the skull
                    and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (@skill[Arcana]) check concludes that it came from a mind
                    flayer. Any attempt to pry the skull from the stone causes it to shatter and fall away, revealing a
                    crystal shard where the illithid's brain would have been.</p>

                    <p>The crystal shard lodged inside the fossilized mind flayer skull is a @item[psi crystal|IDRotF]
                        (see <a
                            href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,22,%7b%40item%20psi%20crystal%7cidrotf%7d,0">appendix
                            D</a>). The psychic trauma that the mind flayer endured when it died caused the crystal to
                        form in its mind. A character can use a miner's pick to pry loose the psi crystal.</p>

                    <p>A character who attunes to this <em>psi crystal</em> gains a form of indefinite madness (see the
                        @table[indefinite madness|| Indefinite Madness table] in the <a
                            href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>).
                        Determine the result secretly, then convey this information only to the character's player. The
                        madness does not end until the character is no longer attuned to the <em>psi crystal</em>. While
                        the madness lasts, the character can hear a repeating telepathic distress signal put out by an
                        illithid ship that crashed in the mountains and track the signal to its source (see "Id
                        Ascendant"). The only way to block the signal is by ending the character's attunement to the
                        <em>psi crystal</em>.</p>

            <p>If the characters return to Speaker Masthew and tell him the mine is cleared of monsters, he thanks them
                profusely and explains that he must inspect the mine to verify its safety before they can be paid. He
                encourages the characters to spend a few days in Termalaine while he conducts the investigation.</p>

                characters the next day and pays them 50 gp for their services. If Trex is still in the mine and Janth's
                ghost wasn't laid to rest, Oarus returns to Termalaine possessed by the ghost. If the kobolds are gone
                but the grell remains, Oarus is killed by the grell and doesn't return, leaving the town without a
                speaker. If the grell is still in the mine when it reopens, a handful of local miners disappear over the
                next few days before the decision is made to close the mine for good.</p>
            <p>If the characters bring the kobolds to Termalaine, Oarus is initially hesitant to let them stay in the
                town. After hearing about their willingness to work, he decides to give them a chance and offers them
                menial jobs. The kobolds, eager to prove themselves, turn out to be good workers. The townsfolk tease
                them at first, but eventually the kobolds win them over. Janth's ghost, if it hasn't been laid to rest,
                finds someone else to possess, causing Trex to revert to his skittish, much less intelligent self.</p>
