    <p>A imaginação é um ingrediente chave de Dungeons & Dragons, um jogo cooperativo no qual os personagens que você interpreta embarcam em aventuras juntos em mundos de fantasia cheios de monstros e magia.</p>
    <p>Em D&D, a ação acontece na imaginação dos jogadores, e é narrada por todos juntos. Aqui está um vislumbre de como isso se parece:</p>

Torres de pedra em ruínas — talvez postos de guarda abandonados — se elevam sobre a passagem. Além deles, você vê um abismo aberto desaparecendo em uma névoa profunda abaixo. Uma ponte levadiça abaixada cruza o abismo, suas correntes rangendo ao vento. Gárgulas de pedra olham para você das altas muralhas, e uma luz pálida vaza para o pátio a partir das portas abertas do castelo.</p>

        <h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="14"><span class="entry-title-inner">Rhythm of Play</span></h1>
        <p>The three main pillars of D&D play are @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#social-interaction]{social interaction}, @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#exploration]{exploration}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#combat]{combat}. Whichever one you're experiencing, the game unfolds according to this basic pattern:</p>
        <ul class="rd__list rd__list-decimal">
            <li class="rd__li ">
                <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="The Dungeon Master Describes a Scene"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">The Dungeon Master Describes a Scene.</span> The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, and so on).</p>
            </li>
            <li class="rd__li ">
                <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="The Players Describe What Their Characters Do"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">The Players Describe What Their Characters Do.</span> Typically, the characters stick together as they travel through a dungeon or another environment. Sometimes different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the DM ensures that every character has a chance to act and decides how to resolve their activity. In combat, the characters take turns.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="rd__li ">
                <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="The DM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers' Actions"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">The DM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers' Actions.</span> Sometimes resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to open a door, the DM might say the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the game back to step 1.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This pattern holds during every game session (each time you sit down to play D&D), whether the adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a dragon. In certain situations—particularly combat—the action is more structured, and everyone takes turns.</p>
        <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset" data-roll-name-ancestor="Exceptions Supersede General Rules">
            <h4 class="entry-title-inner"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="15">Exceptions Supersede General Rules</span></h4>
            <p><span title="Page 8">p8</span></p>
            <p>General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn't explicitly say otherwise.</p>
            <p>The game also includes elements—class features, feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.</p>

        <h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="16"><span class="entry-title-inner">An Ongoing Game</span></h1>
        <p>Sometimes a session of D&D is a complete game in itself (often called a "one-shot"), where you play a short adventure that lasts for just one session. More often, though, D&D sessions are connected in a longer adventure that takes several sessions to complete, and adventures can be strung together into a larger narrative called a campaign.</p>
        <p>A campaign is like a TV series, while an adventure is like a season of the series. And a game session is like a single episode—it might be self-contained, but it usually links to the larger plot if there is one.</p>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Adventures" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="17"><span class="entry-title-inner">Adventures</span></h2>
            <p>An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased (the examples of play in this chapter are inspired by a published adventure, <a href="https://5e.tools/adventure.html#CoS">Curse of Strahd</a>). In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, such as an underground dungeon, a wondrous wilderness, or a magic-filled city. It includes a cast of nonplayer characters controlled by the DM. Often one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure's action.</p>
            <p>During an adventure, the adventurers explore environments, events, and creatures presented by the DM. Battles, traps, negotiations, mysteries, and more arise during these explorations.</p>
            <p>Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges and take only one session to complete. A long adventure might involve many combats, interactions, and other challenges and take dozens of sessions.</p>
        </div>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="18"><span class="entry-title-inner">Campaigns</span></h2>
            <p>A campaign is a series of adventures with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative.</p>
            <p>Some campaigns are episodic, where each adventure is its own tale and not much besides the player characters links it to the next one. Other campaigns involve long-running plots, a cast of recurring NPCs, and themes that span multiple adventures, leading toward a climactic conclusion.</p>
            <p>As with adventures, a DM might create a campaign from scratch, assemble a campaign from published adventures, or mix homemade material with published material. And the campaign might take place in a world of the DM's creation or in a published campaign setting, such as the Forgotten Realms or Greyhawk (the latter is described in the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>).</p>

            <p><span title="Page 8">p8</span></p>
            <p>Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make an exception and tell you to round up.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Dice Notation" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="21"><span class="entry-title-inner">Dice Notation</span></h2>
            <p>The dice used in D&D are referred to by the letter <em>d</em> followed by the die's number of sides: [[/r d4]], [[/r d6]], [[/r d8]], [[/r d10]], [[/r d12]], and [[/r d20]]. For instance, a [[/r d6]] is a six-sided die (the cube that many games use). The illustration on this page shows what each die looks like.</p>
            <p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, along with any numbers to add or subtract. For example, "[[/r 3d8 + 5]]" means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Percentile Dice" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="22"><span class="entry-title-inner">Percentile Dice</span></h3>
                <p>The rules sometimes refer to a [[/r d100]]. While such dice exist, the common way to roll [[/r 1d100]] uses a pair of ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9, known as percentile dice. One die—that you designate before rolling—gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 for the tens digit and a 1 for the ones digit, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100.</p>
                <p>Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p>

                <p>The same <em>d</em> notation appears in the expression "[[/r 1d3]]," even though it's rare to find dice with only three sides. To simulate rolling [[/r 1d3]], roll [[/r 1d6]] and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up).</p>

            <p>Here are the most common uses of dice in D&D.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="D20 Test" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="25"><span class="entry-title-inner">D20 Test</span></h3>
                <p>The 20-sided die ([[/r d20]]) is the most important die you'll use in the game. It's central to the core mechanic—called @variantrule[D20 Test|XPHB|D20 Tests]—the game uses to determine whether creatures succeed or fail at the things they attempt during the game (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#d20-tests]{D20 Tests}" later in this chapter). You roll a [[/r d20]] whenever your character tries to do something that the DM decides has a chance of both success and failure. The higher your roll, the more likely it is that you succeed.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Damage" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="26"><span class="entry-title-inner">Damage</span></h3>
                <p>The most common use for dice other than the [[/r d20]] is to determine damage. When you make a successful attack roll (one kind of @variantrule[D20 Test|XPHB]), you roll damage to see how effective the attack is. When you cast a spell, you might also roll damage. Different weapons and spells use different dice for damage. For example, a @item[Dagger|XPHB] uses [[/r 1d4]], a @item[Greataxe|XPHB] uses [[/r 1d12]], and a @spell[Fireball|XPHB] spell uses [[/r 8d6]].</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="27"><span class="entry-title-inner">Random Tables</span></h3>
                <p>Occasionally, you'll see a table that uses a die roll to generate a random result. On these tables, you'll see a die expression, such as [[/r d10]] or [[/r d100]], in the header of the leftmost column. Roll that die, and find the number you rolled (or a range containing that number) in that column. Read across that row for the result. For example, the @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#trinkets]{Trinkets table} in @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 2} uses a [[/r d100]].</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="28"><span class="entry-title-inner">Percentage Chances</span></h3>
                <p>Sometimes you might see a rule describing a percentage chance of something happening. For example, a rule might say there is a 5 percent chance of something happening. You can determine whether that thing happens by rolling percentile dice; if the roll is equal to or less than the percentage chance (a 01 to 05, in this example), it happens.</p>

                    <p>Part of the fun of D&D is interpreting what die rolls mean in the story. The randomness that dice bring often introduces the unexpected: an expert fails, a novice succeeds, or any number of other twists. When a @variantrule[D20 Test|XPHB] or another roll produces a surprise, the Dungeon Master often gives a fun description of what happened. If you're a player, look for opportunities to interpret your character's die rolls and describe why things unfolded unexpectedly or even humorously.</p>

            <p>An ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertaining a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The DM and the rules often call for an ability check when a creature attempts something other than an attack that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the result.</p>

            <p>Sometimes a @variantrule[D20 Test|XPHB] is modified by Advantage or Disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a [[/r d20]] roll, while Disadvantage reflects negative circumstances.</p>
            <p>You usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage through the use of special abilities and actions. The DM can also decide that circumstances grant Advantage or impose Disadvantage.</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="50"><span class="entry-title-inner">Roll Two D20s</span></h3>
                <p>When a roll has either Advantage or Disadvantage, roll a second [[/r d20]] when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For example, if you have Disadvantage and roll an 18 and a 3, use the 3. If you instead have Advantage and roll those numbers, use the 18.</p>

                <p>If multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant Advantage on it, you still roll only two d20s. Similarly, if multiple situations impose Disadvantage on a roll, you roll only two d20s.</p>
                <p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both Advantage and Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them, and you roll one [[/r d20]]. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose Disadvantage and only one grants Advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither Advantage nor Disadvantage.</p>

                <p>When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and something in the game lets you reroll or replace the [[/r d20]], you can reroll or replace only one die, not both. You choose which one.</p>
                <p>For example, if you have @variantrule[Heroic Inspiration|XPHB] (see the sidebar) and roll a 3 and an 18 on an ability check that has Advantage or Disadvantage, you could expend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one of those dice, not both of them.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes the DM or a rule gives you Heroic Inspiration. If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new roll.</p>

                        <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Only One at a Time.</span> You can never have more than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something gives you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it, you can give it to a player character in your group who lacks it.</p>

Typically, DMs award it when you do something particularly heroic, in character, or entertaining. It's a reward for making the game more fun for everyone playing.</p>
                        <p>Other rules might allow your character to gain Heroic Inspiration independent of the DM's decision. For example, Human characters start each day with Heroic Inspiration.</p>

        <p>Characters and monsters are good at various things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while others can use only a few. Some are better at understanding people's motives, and others are better at unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature's capabilities. A character's Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels (described in @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 2}). A monster's Proficiency Bonus is based on its @variantrule[Challenge Rating|XPHB]. The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined.</p>
        <p>This bonus is applied to a @variantrule[D20 Test|XPHB] when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or with an item that the creature uses to make the @variantrule[D20 Test|XPHB]. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.</p>

            <p>Your Proficiency Bonus can't be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (&Reference[skill=Deception] or &Reference[skill=Persuasion]) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus if you're proficient in either skill, but you don't add it twice if you're proficient in both skills.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before being added. For example, the @variantrule[Expertise|XPHB] feature doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once.</p>

            <p>Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an ability check. The descriptions of the actions you take (see @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#actions]{"Actions"} later in this chapter) specify which skill applies if you make an ability check for that action, and many other rules note when a skill is relevant. The DM has the ultimate say on whether a skill is relevant in a situation.</p>
            <p>If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks involving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a creature can still make ability checks involving that skill but doesn't add its Proficiency Bonus. For example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (&Reference[skill=Athletics]) check. If the character has &Reference[skill=Athletics] proficiency, the character adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they make the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.</p>

                    <p>Each skill proficiency is associated with an ability check. For example, the &Reference[skill=Intimidation] skill is associated with Charisma. In some situations, the DM might allow you to apply your skill proficiency to a different ability check. For example, if a character tries to intimidate someone through a show of physical strength, the DM might ask for a Strength (&Reference[skill=Intimidation]) check rather than a Charisma (&Reference[skill=Intimidation]) check. That character would make a Strength check and add their Proficiency Bonus if they have &Reference[skill=Intimidation] proficiency.</p>

For example, proficiency in Wisdom saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.</p>
            <p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws, representing that class's training in evading or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example, are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves; they train to resist mental assault.</p>

        <p>Player characters and monsters can also do things not covered by these actions. Many class features and other abilities provide additional action options, and you can improvise other actions. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the Dungeon Master tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of @variantrule[D20 Test|XPHB] you need to make, if any.</p>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="One Thing at a Time" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="65"><span class="entry-title-inner">One Thing at a Time</span></h2>
            <p>The game uses actions to govern how much you can do at one time. You can take only one action at a time. This principle is most important in combat, as explained in "@UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#combat]{Combat}" later in this chapter.</p>
            <p>Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a social interaction, you can try to @action[Influence|XPHB] a creature or use the @action[Search|XPHB] action to read the creature's body language, but you can't do both at the same time. And when you're exploring a dungeon, you can't simultaneously use the @action[Search|XPHB] action to look for traps and use the @action[Help|XPHB] action to aid another character who's trying to open a stuck door (with the @action[Utilize|XPHB] action).</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="66"><span class="entry-title-inner">Bonus Actions</span></h2>
            <p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a Rogue to take a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability, a spell, or another feature of the game states that you can do something as a Bonus Action. You otherwise don't have a Bonus Action to take.</p>
            <p>You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn, so you must choose which Bonus Action to use if you have more than one available.</p>
            <p>You choose when to take a Bonus Action during your turn unless the Bonus Action's timing is specified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus Action.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Reactions" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="67"><span class="entry-title-inner">Reactions</span></h2>
            <p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a Reaction. A Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The @action[Opportunity Attack|XPHB], described @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#opportunity-attacks]{later in this chapter}, is the most common type of Reaction.</p>
            <p>When you take a Reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the Reaction.</p>
            <p>In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immediately after its trigger unless the Reaction's description says otherwise.</p>

                <p><span title="Page 15">p15</span></p>
                <p>Ask yourself as you play, "What would my character do?" Playing a role involves some amount of getting into another person's head and understanding what motivates them and how those motivations translate into action. In D&D, those actions unfold against the backdrop of a fantastic world full of situations we can only imagine. How does your character react to those situations?</p>
                <p>This advice comes with one important caveat: avoid character choices that ruin the fun of the other players and the DM. Choose actions that delight you and your friends.</p>

        <p>During their adventures, player characters meet many different people and face some monsters that would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it's time for social interaction, which takes many forms. For example, you might try to convince a burglar to confess to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The Dungeon Master assumes the roles of any nonplayer characters who are participating.</p>
        <p>An NPC's attitude toward your character is @variantrule[Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly], @variantrule[Indifferent [Attitude]|XPHB|Indifferent], or @variantrule[Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile], as defined in the @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000010]{rules glossary}. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help, and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder.</p>
        <p>Social interactions progress in two ways: through roleplaying and ability checks.</p>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Roleplaying" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="70"><span class="entry-title-inner">Roleplaying</span></h2>
            <p>Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it's you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions.</p>
            <p>As you roleplay, consider whether you prefer an active approach or a descriptive approach, each of which is described in "@UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#social-interaction-example]{Social Interaction Example.}"</p>
            <p>The DM uses an NPC's personality and your character's actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant refuses to help if the characters badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.</p>
            <p>When interacting with an NPC, pay attention to the DM's portrayal of the NPC's personality. You might be able to learn an NPC's goals and then use that information to influence the NPC.</p>
            <p>If you offer NPCs something they want or play on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you can form friendships, ward off violence, or learn a key piece of information. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble's allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will likely fail.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Ability Checks" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="71"><span class="entry-title-inner">Ability Checks</span></h2>
            <p>Ability checks can be key in determining the outcome of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's attitude, but there might still be an element of chance if the DM wants dice to play a role in determining an NPC's response to you. In such situations, the DM will typically ask you to take the @action[Influence|XPHB] action.</p>
            <p>Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you will interact with an NPC; use an approach that relies on your group's skill proficiencies. For example, if the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue who is proficient in &Reference[skill=Deception] should lead the discussion.</p>

                <p>Notice throughout the example how Russell and Amy actively roleplay their characters' behavior. In this active approach, they speak with their characters' voices, like an actor taking on a role. The players might even echo their characters' body language. They still need to describe things that can't reasonably be acted out.</p>

                <p>Notice how Phillip describes his character's words and action. Drawing on his mental image of his character, he says what his character does and how the character does it. If this approach is most comfortable for you, keep these things in mind:</p>

                <p>Phillip's character, Gareth, makes a Wisdom (&Reference[skill=Insight]) check to determine whether he reads Ismark's unspoken cues. Wisdom is the ability that measures perceptiveness and intuition. Insight reflects a character's skill at reading other people's moods and intentions. The DM set the DC at 15, which Gareth beats. With a successful Wisdom (&Reference[skill=Insight]) check, Gareth gleans information that wasn't obvious, so it wasn't part of the DM's earlier narration.

            <p>Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an ambush. The Dungeon Master decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, you take the @action[Hide|XPHB] action.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="87"><span class="entry-title-inner">Interacting with Objects</span></h2>
            <p>Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve. The player tells the DM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever or opening a door, and the DM describes what happens. Sometimes, however, rules govern what you can do with an object, as detailed in the following sections.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="What Is an Object?" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="88"><span class="entry-title-inner">What Is an Object?</span></h3>
                <p>For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone. It isn't a building or a vehicle, which are composed of many objects.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Time-Limited Object Interactions" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">

                <p>When time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a creature's movement or action. Any additional interactions require the @action[Utilize|XPHB] action, as explained in "@UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#combat]{Combat}" later in this chapter.</p>

                <p>When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (&Reference[skill=Perception]) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden object's vicinity. On a success, you find the object, other important details, or both.</p>
                <p>If you describe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom (&Reference[skill=Perception]) check won't reveal the object, no matter the check's total.</p>

                <p>You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight of those objects. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the DM might require you to abide by the rules for @variantrule[carrying capacity|XPHB] in the @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000010#carrying-capacity]{rules glossary}.</p>

                <p>As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to damage something more resilient, the DM might use the rules on @variantrule[breaking objects|XPHB] in the @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000010#breaking-objects]{rules glossary}.</p>

            <p>During an adventure, the characters might travel long distances on trips that could take hours or days. The DM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times, or the DM might have you use the travel pace rules below.</p>
            <p>If you need to know how fast you can move when every second matters, see the movement rules in "@UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#combat]{Combat}" later in this chapter.</p>

                <p><span title="Page 20">p20</span></p>
                <p>The adventurers should establish a marching order while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change your marching order outside combat and record the order any way you like: write it down, for example, or arrange miniatures to show it.</p>

                <p>While traveling outside combat, a group can move at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time; if riding horses or other mounts, the group can move twice that distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a @variantrule[Short Rest|XPHB|Short] or @variantrule[Long Rest|XPHB] before they can move at that increased pace again (see @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#mounts-and-vehicles]{chapter 6} for a selection of mounts for sale).

                <p>Many characters have the ability to cast spells, which have a huge variety of effects. Some spells are mostly useful in combat, by dealing damage or imposing conditions. Other spells have utility in exploration. If you're playing a spellcaster, look for a mix of combat-effective and utilitarian spells to help deal with varied challenges.</p>

                <p>A saving throw is used to see whether a creature avoids or resists something. When the chest releases toxic gas, Phillip's and Amy's characters make Constitution saving throws. Constitution is one of the six abilities that measure creatures' capabilities, and it has to do with health and stamina. When they fail their saves, the gas causes them to have the &Reference[condition=Paralyzed] condition.

            <p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls @variantrule[Initiative|XPHB]. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is defeated.</p>

                <p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you.

            <p>A melee attack allows you to attack a target within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon or an @variantrule[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]. Many monsters make melee attacks with claws, teeth, or other body parts. A few spells also involve melee attacks.</p>

            <p>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than a rider and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Mounting and Dismounting" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">

                <p>During your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your @variantrule[Speed|XPHB] (round down). For example, if your Speed is 30 feet, you spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.</p>

                <p>You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and similar creatures have such training.</p>
                <p>The @variantrule[Initiative|XPHB] of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves on your turn as you direct it, and it has only three action options during that turn: @action[Dash|XPHB], @action[Disengage|XPHB], and @action[Dodge|XPHB]. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.</p>
                <p>In contrast, an independent mount—one that lets you ride but ignores your control—retains its place in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes.</p>

            <p>Hit Points represent durability and the will to live. Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current Hit Points can be any number from that maximum down to 0, which is the lowest Hit Points can go.</p>
            <p>Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no effect on your capabilities until you reach 0 Hit Points.</p>
            <p>If you have half your Hit Points or fewer, you're Bloodied, which has no game effect on its own but which might trigger other game effects.</p>

                <p>Adventurers can't spend every hour adventuring. They need rest. Any creature can take hour-long @variantrule[Short Rest|XPHB|Short Rests] in the midst of a day and an 8-hour @variantrule[Long Rest|XPHB] to end it. Regaining Hit Points is one of the main benefits of a rest. The @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000010]{rules glossary} provides the rules for Short and Long Rests.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="155"><span class="entry-title-inner">Damage Rolls</span></h2>
            <p>Each weapon, spell, and damaging monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage dice, add any modifiers, and deal the damage to your target. If there's a penalty to the damage, it's possible to deal 0 damage but not negative damage.</p>
            <p>When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage roll. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don't add your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount that doesn't use a roll, such as the damage of a @item[Blowgun|XPHB]. See @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#weapons]{chapter 6} for weapons' damage dice and @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007]{chapter 7} for spells' damage dice.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="156"><span class="entry-title-inner">Critical Hits</span></h2>
            <p>When you score a Critical Hit, you deal extra damage. Roll the attack's damage dice twice, add them together, and add any relevant modifiers as normal. For example, if you score a Critical Hit with a @item[Dagger|XPHB], roll [[/r 2d4]] for the damage rather than [[/r 1d4]], and add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the Rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you also roll those dice twice.</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="158"><span class="entry-title-inner">Damage against Multiple Targets</span></h3>
                <p>When you create a damaging effect that forces two or more targets to make saving throws against it at the same time, roll the damage once for all the targets. For example, when a wizard casts @spell[Fireball|XPHB], the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.</p>

            <p>Each instance of damage has a type, like Fire or Slashing. Damage types are listed in the @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000010#damage-types]{rules glossary} and have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as @variantrule[Resistance|XPHB], rely on damage types.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="161"><span class="entry-title-inner">Resistance and Vulnerability</span></h2>
            <p>Some creatures and objects have Resistance or Vulnerability to certain damage types. If you have Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against you (round down). If you have Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against you. For example, if you have Resistance to Cold damage, such damage is halved against you, and if you have Vulnerability to Fire damage, such damage is doubled against you.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="No Stacking" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">

                <p>Multiple instances of Resistance or Vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if you have Resistance to Necrotic damage as well as Resistance to all damage, Necrotic damage is reduced by half against you.</p>

                <p>Modifiers to damage are applied in the following order: adjustments such as bonuses, penalties, or multipliers are applied first; Resistance is applied second; and Vulnerability is applied third.</p>
                <p>For example, a creature has Resistance to all damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage, and it's within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. If it takes 28 Fire damage, the damage is first reduced by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature's Resistance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled for its Vulnerability (to 22).</p>

            <p>Some creatures and objects have Immunity to certain damage types and conditions. Immunity to a damage type means you don't take damage of that type, and Immunity to a condition means you aren't affected by it.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Healing" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="165"><span class="entry-title-inner">Healing</span></h2>
            <p>Hit Points can be restored by magic, such as the @spell[Cure Wounds|XPHB] spell or a @item[Potion of Healing|XDMG], or by a @variantrule[Short Rest|XPHB|Short] or @variantrule[Long Rest|XPHB].</p>
            <p>When you receive healing, add the restored Hit Points to your current Hit Points. Your Hit Points can't exceed your Hit Point maximum, so any Hit Points regained in excess of the maximum are lost. For example, if you receive 8 Hit Points of healing and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of 20, you regain 6 Hit Points, not 8.</p>

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Hit Point Maximum of 0.</span> A creature dies if its Hit Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life energy, reducing a creature's Hit Point maximum.</p>

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Massive Damage.</span> When damage reduces a character to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the character dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to 0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.</p>

                    <p>When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point and give it the &Reference[condition=Unconscious] condition.

                <p>A Stable creature doesn't make Death Saving Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still has the &Reference[condition=Unconscious] condition.

        <p>The definition of a condition specifies what happens to its recipient while affected by it, and some conditions apply other conditions.</p>

It's a special property of this spell that it can be cast even when it's not the caster's turn, using her Reaction (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#reactions]{Actions}" earlier in this chapter).</p>

See the @UUID[JournalEntry.XVNCWYcNan2y5J0B.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000010#area-of-effect]{rules glossary} for more on areas of effect.</p>

                <p>The skeletons have 13 Hit Points each, so the spells and attacks in this example deal enough damage to destroy them. If a spell or an attack dealt less than 13 damage, the DM would keep track of the damage each skeleton has taken until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and is destroyed.</p>
