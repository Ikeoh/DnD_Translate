            <p>Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</p>

                <p>Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll [[/r 1d20]] immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.</p>
                <p>If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.</p>

                <p>Immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot, you can create an effect of your choice from the @table[Wild Magic Surge|XPHB] table instead of rolling on that table. You can choose any effect in the table except for the final row, and if the chosen effect involves a roll, you must make it.</p>
                <p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a @variantrule[Long Rest|XPHB].</p>
