Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC <span class="rd__dc">8</span> plus your Constitution modifier and @variantrule[Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus]). On a failed save, a creature takes [[/damage 1d10]] damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by [[/damage 1d10]] when you reach character levels 5 ([[/damage 2d10]]), 11 ([[/damage 3d10]]), and 17 ([[/damage 4d10]]).</p>
            <p>You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your @variantrule[Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a @variantrule[Long Rest|XPHB].</p>

As a @variantrule[Bonus Action|XPHB], you sprout spectral wings on your back that last for 10 minutes or until you retract the wings (no action required) or have the &Reference[condition=Incapacitated] condition. During that time, you have a @variantrule[Fly Speed|XPHB] equal to your @variantrule[Speed|XPHB]. Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a @variantrule[Long Rest|XPHB].</p>

            <p>The ancestors of dragonborn hatched from the eggs of chromatic and metallic dragons. One story holds that these eggs were blessed by the dragon gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who wanted to populate the multiverse with people created in their image. Another story claims that dragons created the first dragonborn without the gods' blessings. Whatever their origin, dragonborn have made homes for themselves on the Material Plane.</p>
            <p>Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragons—scaly, bright-eyed, and thick-boned with horns on their heads—and their coloration and other features are reminiscent of their draconic ancestors.</p>
