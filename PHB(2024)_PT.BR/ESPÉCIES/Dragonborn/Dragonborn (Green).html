        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Breath Weapon" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
            <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Breath Weapon.</span> When you take the @action[Attack|XPHB] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot @variantrule[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone] or a 30-foot @variantrule[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Line] that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC <span class="rd__dc">8</span> plus your Constitution modifier and @variantrule[Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus]). On a failed save, a creature takes [[/damage 1d10 type=poison]] damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by [[/damage 1d10]] when you reach character levels 5 ([[/damage 2d10]]), 11 ([[/damage 3d10]]), and 17 ([[/damage 4d10]]).</p>
            <p>You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your @variantrule[Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a @variantrule[Long Rest|XPHB].</p>

            <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Draconic Flight.</span> When you reach character level 5, you can channel draconic magic to give yourself temporary flight. As a @variantrule[Bonus Action|XPHB], you sprout spectral wings on your back that last for 10 minutes or until you retract the wings (no action required) or have the &Reference[condition=Incapacitated] condition. During that time, you have a @variantrule[Fly Speed|XPHB] equal to your @variantrule[Speed|XPHB]. Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a @variantrule[Long Rest|XPHB].</p>
