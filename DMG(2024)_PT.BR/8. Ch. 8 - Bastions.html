    <p>A Bastion is a location that belongs to a player character: a home, a stronghold, and a place of power that the character develops over the course of a campaign. A Bastion offers a character temporary refuge from the dangerous world of adventuring, and it provides opportunities for a character to craft magic items, conduct research, harvest poisons, build ships, and carry out a range of other activities.</p>
    <p>As DM, you decide whether Bastions are available in a campaign. Bastions are best suited to campaigns that allow characters to return to their Bastions during intervals when they're not actively adventuring. Not every character needs to have a Bastion. It's fine for some players in your campaign to opt in to Bastion ownership and others to opt out.</p>
    <p>There's no need to choose between going on adventures and commanding a Bastion; a character can do both at once. A Bastion has special facilities that generate benefits, and these facilities can also undertake projects while the character is otherwise occupied.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, a Bastion is a creative playground for a player and a shared storytelling space in the campaign. Be as permissive as you can with the stories players tell in their Bastions, but players should know their control might be limited by the campaign's larger story, which you strive to make fun for everyone.</p>

        <h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="970"><span class="entry-title-inner">Gaining a Bastion</span></h1>
        <p>If you allow Bastions in your campaign, characters acquire their Bastions when they reach level 5. You and the players can decide together how these Bastions come into being. A character might inherit or receive a parcel of land on which to build their Bastion (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#marks-of-prestige]{Marks of Prestige}" in @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 3}), or they might take a preexisting structure and refurbish it. It's fair to assume that work has been going on behind the scenes of the campaign during a character's early adventuring career, so the Bastion is ready when the character reaches level 5.</p>
        <p>The shape, style, and function of a character's Bastion are up to the player to determine. For example, a Wizard might build a tower, a Cleric might establish a shrine, a Fighter might build a fortified keep or similar stronghold, and a Rogue might establish a guildhall or lodge. Characters of other classes might choose one of these forms or combine them—a Paladin's Bastion might be similar to a Cleric's shrine but as fortified as a Fighter's stronghold. And multiple characters can combine their Bastions to form a single large structure (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#bastion-map]{Bastion Map}").</p>
        <p>Every Bastion has facilities that serve basic needs as well as special ones, such as libraries, menageries, and workshops (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#basic-facilities]{Basic Facilities}" and "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#special-facilities]{Special Facilities}").</p>

        <p>As time passes in the campaign, players take Bastion turns to reflect the activity occurring in their Bastions, whether or not the characters are present. On a Bastion turn, a character can issue orders to the special facilities in their Bastion or issue the @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#maintain]{Maintain} order to the entire Bastion (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#orders]{Orders}").</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="972"><span class="entry-title-inner">Frequency of Bastion Turns</span></h2>
            <p>By default, a Bastion turn occurs every 7 days of in-game time. Here are common examples of players taking one or more Bastion turns:</p>
            <ul class="rd__list">
                <li class="rd__li ">The characters are on a long journey away from their Bastions. After the characters have been away for 7 days, you might say, "Time for a Bastion turn. Since you're not there, we'll assume you issue the @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#maintain]{Maintain} order for your Bastions." Then roll for events as described in the "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#bastion-events]{Bastion Events}" section in this chapter.</li>
                <li class="rd__li ">The characters spend 7 days or more in their Bastions between adventures. You might say, "You have six weeks to spend in your Bastions. Go ahead and resolve six Bastion turns."</li>
                <li class="rd__li ">The characters return to their Bastions in the midst of an adventure. You might say, "You have just enough time to take a Bastion turn before you leave again in the morning."</li>
                <li class="rd__li ">The characters are adventuring near their Bastions and resting in their Bastions at night. You might say, "It's been a week since your last Bastion turn, so you can take one now."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can slow the frequency of Bastion turns to better serve the needs of your players and your campaign. For example, if the characters have months between adventures, you can call for a Bastion turn every month instead of every 7 days, so the characters aren't issuing so many orders or reaping too many benefits at once.</p>

            <p>Two or more players can combine their characters' Bastions into a single structure. Doing so doesn't change the number of special facilities each Bastion can have, how those special facilities work, or who issues orders to each Bastion. Each Bastion retains its own hirelings, which can't be sent to or shared with another Bastion. Bastion Defenders are handled differently: if some event deprives one character's Bastion of defenders, another character can apply all or some of those losses to their Bastion instead, provided the two Bastions are combined.</p>

At level 9, a character gains two additional special facilities of their choice for which they qualify; they gain one additional facility at level 13 and another at level 17. The Special Facility Acquisition table shows the total number of special facilities in a character's Bastion. Each new special facility immediately becomes part of the character's Bastion when the character reaches the level.</p>
        <p>Each time a character gains a level, that character can replace one of their Bastion's special facilities with another for which the character qualifies.</p>

            <p>Each special facility has a level. A character must be that level or higher to gain that facility. A special facility might also have a prerequisite the character must meet to gain that facility. For example, only a character who can use an Arcane Focus or a tool as a @variantrule[Spellcasting Focus|XPHB] can have an @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#arcane-study]{Arcane Study}.</p>

            <p>A special facility occupies a certain amount of space (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#facility-space]{Facility Space}"). A player can configure the squares of a special facility as desired on the Bastion's map. A special facility can be enlarged to grant additional benefits if its description says so.</p>

            <p>A special facility comes with one or more hirelings who work in the facility, maintain it, and execute Bastion orders there, as described in the next section. A player can assign names and personalities to hirelings in their character's Bastion using the same tools DMs use to @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#nonplayer-characters]{create NPCs} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 3}).</p>
            <p>Each special facility in a Bastion generates enough income to pay the salary of its hirelings. Hirelings follow the orders they're given and are loyal to the Bastion's owner.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="984"><span class="entry-title-inner">Orders</span></h2>
            <p>On a Bastion turn, a character in their Bastion can issue special orders—called Bastion orders—to one or more of their Bastion's special facilities. A character needn't issue orders to all the special facilities in their Bastion on a given Bastion turn.</p>
            <p>The Maintain order is unusual; it is issued to the whole Bastion rather than to one or more special facilities. If a character isn't in their Bastion on a given Bastion turn, the Bastion acts as though it were issued the Maintain order on that turn unless the owner can communicate with the Bastion hirelings using the @spell[Sending|XPHB] spell or similar magic.</p>
            <p>The orders are as follows:</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Craft" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="985"><span class="entry-title-inner">Craft</span></h3>
                <p>Hirelings in the special facility craft an item that can be made in that facility. During the time required to craft an item, the facility can't be used to craft anything else, even if a special ability allows the facility to carry out two orders at once. The hirelings have proficiencies with Artisan's Tools as specified in the facility's description.</p>

            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Empower" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">

                <p>The special facility confers a temporary empowerment to you or someone else.</p>

                <p>Hirelings gather a resource produced in the special facility. During the time required to harvest a resource, the facility can't be used to harvest anything else, even if a special ability allows the facility to carry out two orders at once.</p>

                <p>All the Bastion's hirelings focus on maintaining the Bastion rather than executing orders in special facilities. Issuing this order prohibits other orders from being issued to the Bastion on the current Bastion turn. Each time the Maintain order is issued, the DM rolls once on the @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#bastion-events]{Bastion Events} table at the end of this chapter. Bastion events are resolved before the next Bastion turn.</p>

                <p>Hirelings recruit creatures to the Bastion. These creatures might include one or more Bastion Defenders, whose main purpose is to defend the Bastion if it is attacked (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#bastion-events]{Bastion Events}" at the end of this chapter).

        <p>Immediately after a character issues the @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#maintain]{Maintain} order to their Bastion, the DM rolls once on the Bastion Events table to determine what event, if any, befalls the Bastion before the next Bastion Turn. If an event occurs, the DM reads the event aloud to the player whose character controls that Bastion. (All the events are described in the sections following the table.) The event is resolved immediately, with the player and DM working together to expand story details as needed. If multiple characters issue the Maintain order on the same Bastion turn, roll once on the table for each of them, resolving each event separately even if the Bastions are combined.</p>
        <p>Bastion events occur only when a Bastion is operating under the Maintain order, which often means that the Bastion's owner isn't present in the Bastion at the time. That means these events can be opportunities for the player to take on the role of the Bastion's hirelings and roleplay their reactions to these events. The DM can even turn a Bastion event into a cutscene where each player takes on the role of one of the Bastion's hirelings (under the guidance of the player whose character owns the Bastion).</p>

        <p>Regardless of how the Bastion falls, the player can work with the DM to establish a new Bastion and determine how it comes into being. Use the @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007#special-facility-acquisition]{Special Facility Acquisition} table to determine how many special facilities come with it. The new Bastion also starts with two basic facilities (one Cramped and one Roomy) of the player's choice.</p>
