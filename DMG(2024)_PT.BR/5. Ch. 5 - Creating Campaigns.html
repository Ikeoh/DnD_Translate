    <p>If encounters are the building blocks of a D&D adventure, then adventures are the building blocks of a D&D campaign, for a campaign is what you get when you string two or more adventures together. A campaign setting is the world in which those adventures take place—both a backdrop for your adventures and a hotbed of conflicts and personalities that can inspire and drive adventures.</p>

        <p>You might have noticed that these steps are similar to the "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003#step-by-step-adventures]{Step-by-Step Adventures}" list at the start of @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003]{chapter 4}. In many ways, a campaign is just an adventure writ large. In an ongoing campaign, one adventure flows naturally into the next.</p>
        <p>Later sections of this chapter offer inspiration and advice for each of these four steps. The chapter concludes with a campaign example.</p>

        <p>At the start of any campaign, there's a buzz of excitement as you and your players look forward to creating a new world together—one full of adventure and promise. Every game session is a chance for you to show off more of the campaign setting and deepen your players' investment in it.</p>
        <p>If your campaign lasts for months or years, sustaining that high level of excitement—yours as well as your players'—takes effort. An important tool to help you keep interest in the campaign high is a campaign journal, a collection of notes from past sessions. Use your journal to refresh your memory on events that transpired early in the campaign and bring closure to unresolved conflicts and mysteries.</p>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Keeping a Journal" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="536"><span class="entry-title-inner">Keeping a Journal</span></h2>
            <p>A campaign journal documents the progression of your campaign, from the first game session to the last. Your journal can take whatever form works best for you. It might be a physical notebook; a binder of loose notes, maps, and tracking sheets; a wiki; or a collection of files on your computer. Journal entries are best organized by date or game session. (Some DMs prefer the term "episode" to "game session," but the terms are interchangeable.)</p>
            <p>A sample Campaign Journal page is provided. Make copies of it, or use it as inspiration for your own journal pages.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="537"><span class="entry-title-inner">Using Your Journal</span></h2>
            <p>Use your journal to plan out your next game session (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000000#preparing-a-session]{Preparing a Session}" in @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000000]{chapter 1}). Then, when the game session is over, use the journal to capture anything else of importance that might have bearing on future sessions, such as the name of an NPC you created on the fly or a critical piece of information the characters learned.</p>
            <p>During a game session, you can use your campaign journal to quickly recall a piece of information you've forgotten (such as the name of a character's mule) or to jot down things you want to remember later (such as the name of a tavern). In this way, the journal becomes a living chronicle of the campaign in flight.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Foreshadowing" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="538"><span class="entry-title-inner">Foreshadowing</span></h3>
                <p>Foreshadowing is a storytelling technique that never goes out of style. Players love it when something happens in a game session that hearkens to some event from an earlier session.</p>
                <p>Foreshadowing is about planting seeds early so you can reap the rewards later. Having an up-to-date campaign journal makes foreshadowing easier because you can reread your notes from earlier game sessions and identify things that could resurface in upcoming sessions, giving past events greater weight or a bigger payoff. Consider the following example.</p>
                <p>The characters find the dead body of an unidentified halfling adventurer. A search of the body yields a cameo necklace containing the portrait of another halfling. A character decides to keep the cameo, which was intended as a bit of embellishment. You make a note of it in your journal. Months later, while planning a future session, you flip through the journal and are reminded of the cameo. It inspires you to plan a chance encounter with another halfling, whom the characters might recognize as the one depicted in the cameo. What happens if the characters return the cameo to this halfling? This halfling could be tied to a bigger plot or have information that could help the characters resolve some conflict. Suddenly, a minor trinket foreshadows bigger events to come.</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="539"><span class="entry-title-inner">Adventure Stockpile</span></h3>
                <p>Besides tracking each session of your campaign, keep a list of adventure ideas. Even if you don't end up using every adventure idea, having a stockpile will keep you ready for whatever your players throw at you, and you can even borrow pieces of various ideas to incorporate into future adventures. Not every adventure needs to build on earlier plots; a good stand-alone adventure tucked in the middle of a serialized campaign can be a welcome change of pace for you and your players.</p>

        <p>Everything outlined about the story of an adventure in @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003]{chapter 4} is true of a campaign's story as well: a campaign is like a series of comics or TV shows, where each adventure (like an issue of a comic or a TV episode) tells a self-contained story that contributes to the larger story. Just like with an adventure, a campaign's story isn't predetermined, because the actions of the players' characters will influence how the story plays out.</p>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Campaign Characters" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">

            <p>The characters are the focus of every D&D adventure, and their players are your partners in developing their characters' epic journeys.</p>
            <p>By working with your players to understand what excites them most, you can craft stories they want to see their characters star in. You can also more effectively draw players into adventure plots (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003#draw-in-the-players]{Draw In the Players}" in @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003]{chapter 4}) if you understand what motivates both them and their characters.</p>

                <p>It's not up to you to create every aspect of a D&D campaign. Players contribute through their characters' actions and by directly sharing what they want to see in a campaign. You can learn about your players' preferences in two ways:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle">
                    <li class="rd__li ">
                        <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Direct Input"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Direct Input.</span> Ask your players what they want to do in a campaign. Regularly inquire about how they think the campaign is going, what they'd like to experience more of, and what elements they'd like to explore further. After a session concludes and between sessions are great times to ask players for thoughts about the campaign.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">
                        <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Indirect Input"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Indirect Input.</span> The choices a player makes, starting at character creation, can indicate what they want to see in the game. For example, a Rogue player likely wants opportunities for subtlety or skulduggery, while a Barbarian player likely craves combat. Take note of what encounters players are enthusiastic about, and seek ways to help the players' characters shine.</p>
                    </li>

                <p>Like most protagonists in film and literature, D&D adventurers face challenges and change through the experience of overcoming them. By incorporating each character's motivations into your adventures and setting higher stakes through play, you'll help characters grow in exciting ways. You can use the @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004#dms-character-tracker]{DM's Character Tracker} sheet to keep track of key information about each character.

                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Character Motivations" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Character Motivations.</span> For each character, think about what motivates them to adventure. Motivations generally fall into the following categories:</p>
                    <ul class="rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle">
                        <li class="rd__li ">
                            <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Goal"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Goal.</span> A character's goal is a short-term reason for the character to adventure. At the start of a campaign, this might be a desire for treasure, a thirst for excitement, or some need from a character's backstory. As characters continue to adventure, they'll find different goals to pursue, such as finding a lost relic, honoring an ancestor, avenging a fallen mentor, or defeating a villain.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="rd__li ">
                            <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Ambition"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Ambition.</span> A character's ambition is a broad, personal aspiration the character hopes to achieve through a lifetime of adventuring. A character might dream of becoming a legendary knight or bringing peace to their homeland. Ambitions might be unrelated to the character's current goal.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="rd__li ">
                            <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Quirks and Whims"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Quirks and Whims.</span> Quirks and whims are a character's preferences, impulses, or other traits. They often emerge during play, such as a character's tendency to one-up a rude innkeeper or their oft-expressed fondness for displacer beast fur.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Players often reveal their characters' motivations through play. If you're uncertain or a character's motivations seem to have changed, it's OK to ask players for clarification.</p>
                </div>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Family, Friends, and Foes" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Family, Friends, and Foes.</span> A character's origin (species and background) implies some amount of backstory, suggesting the character's family and what the character did before becoming an adventurer. Take note of specific background characters—friends, foes, family members, and others—who might appear in the campaign.</p>
                    <p>Should these background characters become important to the campaign, work with the player to develop them in detail. Revealing a character's lost sibling or childhood rival midcampaign should be handled carefully to avoid straining credulity. Make sure a player is comfortable with new developments about their character before introducing them.</p>
                </div>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Character-Focused Adventures" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Character-Focused Adventures.</span> Adventures should occasionally highlight character motivations or elements of their backstory. Here are a few examples of character-focused adventures:</p>
                    <ul class="rd__list">
                        <li class="rd__li ">A rival from a character's past shows up to settle a grudge.</li>
                        <li class="rd__li ">A sneaky character puts their skills to the test by leading the rest of the party to conduct a heist.</li>
                        <li class="rd__li ">A character learns the location of a magic item needed to save their hometown.</li>
                        <li class="rd__li ">A spellcasting character must undertake a trial to join an exclusive group of spellcasters.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Any adventure that focuses on a single character should incentivize the whole party to participate—even if just to help their companion. Avoid focusing adventures on one character too often, and look for opportunities to have character-focused adventures for each character from time to time.</p>
                </div>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Setting New Goals" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Setting New Goals.</span> Characters can change their goals whenever they please, but you can encourage them to do so by giving them significant victories roughly every 5 levels. When characters accomplish their goals, consider the following questions:</p>
                    <ul class="rd__list">
                        <li class="rd__li ">How does completing this goal create a new challenge?</li>
                        <li class="rd__li ">How is this victory only part of what the character wants to achieve?</li>
                        <li class="rd__li ">Who might be upset by the character completing this goal?</li>
                        <li class="rd__li ">What is a reward the character will be excited to receive that also moves them closer to their ambition?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Use the answers to these questions to develop new character goals and to inspire further adventures.</p>
                </div>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Building on the Characters' Actions" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Building on the Characters' Actions.</span> Sometimes it can be fun to let the players steer the campaign by having their characters' actions dictate future adventures. For example, if the characters buy a tavern using the treasure they've amassed, you can adjust the campaign so that the tavern has a role in future adventures. One adventure might involve a competitor trying to put the characters' tavern out of business. Another might use the tavern as the setting for a murder mystery.</p>

            <p>One way to ensure your campaign's longevity is to come up with three compelling conflicts you can create adventures around. Introduce these conflicts early in the campaign. As the campaign unfolds, focus adventures on different conflicts to keep the players' excitement high.</p>
            <p>Use the Campaign Conflicts tracking sheet to record your campaign's conflicts (with room to add details or notes). A conflict can be as big or as small as you like, and it's nice to have at least one conflict that can be resolved quickly. Each conflict should involve the adventurers against some antagonistic force, though you can also create conflicts between two powerful forces without necessarily knowing which force (if either) the adventurers will align themselves with. The "Flavors of Fantasy" section below provides examples of conflicts that reinforce particular themes.</p>
            <p>If a conflict reaches a satisfying end before the end of the campaign, create a new conflict to replace it. You can also replace conflicts that don't resonate with your players as well as conflicts you're having trouble building adventures around.</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="550"><span class="entry-title-inner">Conflict Arcs</span></h3>
                <p>In the same way you think about character arcs over the course of a campaign, think about how each conflict might manifest over the course of the campaign. How do the characters first encounter the conflict? How does the conflict develop over time? What might a climactic ending to that conflict look like?</p>
                <p>One helpful way to structure a conflict arc is to use the @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003#adventure-situations-by-level]{tiers of play} described in @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003]{chapter 4}. Levels 5, 11, and 17 represent milestones in character power and capabilities, and they can also be story milestones in the arc of your campaign. The shift from one tier to another is an ideal time to wrap up a campaign conflict and introduce a new one that has a broader reach and represents a greater threat. The threshold of a new tier can also be an opportunity for characters to realize the scale of a conflict they've been dealing with—to realize, for example, that the bandits they fought throughout their first four levels are merely puppets of an enemy nation they must confront in the second tier.</p>
                <p>The "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004]{Greyhawk}" section in this chapter has examples of conflict arcs.</p>

            <p>Your D&D campaign might be inspired by a particular flavor of fantasy, several of which are discussed in the sections that follow. Any of these fantastical subgenres can be informed and inspired by the cultures, myths, legends, and fantasies of any culture: an epic fantasy campaign could draw on French romances or Chinese wuxia stories, a mythic fantasy campaign could be based on Greek myth or the <em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em>, and so on.</p>

                <p>An epic fantasy campaign emphasizes the conflict between good and evil, with the adventurers on the side of good. These heroic characters are driven by a higher purpose than selfish gain or ambition. Characters might struggle with moral quandaries, fighting the evil tendencies within themselves as well as the evil that threatens the world. And the stories of these campaigns often include an element of romance: tragic affairs between star-crossed lovers, passion that transcends even death, and chaste adoration between knights and nobles.</p>

                <p>The swashbuckling adventures of pirates and musketeers make for a dynamic campaign in which dashing, charming heroes weave their way through palace intrigues and leap from balconies onto waiting horses to escape dogged pursuers. In a swashbuckling campaign, the characters typically spend a lot of time in cities, in royal courts, and aboard seafaring vessels. Nevertheless, the heroes might end up in classic dungeon situations, such as escaping from a prison cell block or searching storm sewers to find a villain's hidden chambers.</p>

                <p>A campaign focused on warfare centers on heroes whose actions turn the tide of battle. The characters carry out specific missions: capture a magical standard that empowers undead armies, gather reinforcements to break a siege, or cut through the enemy's flank to reach a demonic commander. The party might also support the larger army by holding a strategic location until reinforcements arrive, killing enemy scouts, or cutting off supply lines. Information-gathering and diplomatic missions can supplement combat-oriented adventures.</p>

You can send your characters hurtling through a magic mirror to Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, put them aboard a ship traveling between the stars, or set your campaign in a far-future world where laser weapons (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#firearms-and-explosives]{Firearms and Explosives}" in @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 3}) and @item[Wand of Magic Missiles|XDMG|Wands of Magic Missile] exist side by side.</p>

            <p>Just like an @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003#adventure-setting]{adventure's setting} (as described in @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003]{chapter 4}), a campaign setting is an essential part of a campaign's premise, shaping the kinds of stories that unfold there.</p>
            <p>As the DM, you have two options when choosing a campaign setting:</p>
            <ul class="rd__list">
                <li class="rd__li ">Use a published campaign setting.</li>
                <li class="rd__li ">Create your own campaign setting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whether you create your own campaign setting or use a published one, the world of your game is always your own. You can customize it to suit your tastes and those of your players.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Using a Published Setting" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="573"><span class="entry-title-inner">Using a Published Setting</span></h3>
                <p>One advantage of using a published campaign setting is that much of the world-building is done for you. However, this means your players might know as much about the setting as you do. You can get around this by changing key aspects of the setting to better serve your needs, which has the added benefit of challenging your players' expectations.</p>

            <p>At the start of a campaign, you and your players can run a special session—called session zero because it comes before the first session of play—to establish expectations, share ideas, and discuss house rules, with the goal of ensuring the game is a fun experience for everyone involved. The "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000000#ensuring-fun-for-all]{Ensuring Fun for All}" section in @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000000]{chapter 1} covers some of the most important groundwork you need to establish at the start of a new campaign.</p>
            <p>Often session zero includes building characters together. As the DM, you can help players during character creation by advising them on which options best suit the campaign.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Character Creation" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="578"><span class="entry-title-inner">Character Creation</span></h3>
                <p>When players are choosing their characters' classes and origins, you can restrict options that are unsuitable for the campaign.</p>
                <p>Encourage the players to choose different classes so that the adventuring party has a range of abilities. It's less important that the party include multiple backgrounds or species; sometimes it's fun to play an all-Dwarf party or a troupe of adventuring Entertainers.</p>
                <p>The origins the players choose define who their characters were before becoming adventurers. Think about how the characters' backgrounds might inform adventures in your campaign. For example, if a player chooses the Criminal background, help the player flesh out their character's criminal past, and use that information when building relevant storylines into the larger campaign.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Starting Level" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Starting Level.</span> What level are the characters when they start? Many D&D campaigns start the characters at level 1. If you want the characters to be a bit more resilient and your players are experienced, start the campaign at level 3 instead.

                <p>During session zero, help the players come up with explanations for how their characters know each other and have some sort of history together, however brief that history might be. To get a sense of the party's relationships, here are some questions you can ask the players as they create characters:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">Are any of the characters related to each other?</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">What keeps the characters together as a party?</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">What does each character like most about each member of the party?</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Does the group have a patron—an individual or organization that points them toward their adventures?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the players are having trouble coming up with a story for how their characters met, you can suggest the following options.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Bonding Event" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Bonding Event.</span> Some bonding event (such as a wedding, a festival, or a funeral) brings the characters together, whereupon they quickly discover a shared sense of purpose.</p>
                </div>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Happenstance" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Happenstance.</span> Someone puts out a call for adventurers to complete a quest, and the characters answer the call. Alternatively, all the characters could meet by accident, only to discover they're headed to the same place, or they could find themselves trapped together.</p>
                </div>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Mutual Acquaintance" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Mutual Acquaintance.</span> The characters are introduced to one another by a mutual NPC acquaintance whom they all trust. This shared acquaintance could serve as a patron for the party—perhaps a representative of an organization (an academy, a criminal syndicate, a guild, a military force, or a religious order), a politically powerful person (an aristocrat or even a sovereign), or a magical creature like a sphinx or a dragon.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Session zero is a great time to share basic information about the campaign with your players. Such information typically includes the following:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle">
                    <li class="rd__li ">

                    </li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">

For example, the campaign might start on the heels of a great war or on the day of a festival. Describing key events helps set the mood and prepare players for upcoming adventures.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember, you'll always know more about your campaign world than the players do. Having spent all their lives in this world, though, the characters also know more than their players do.

            <p>Begin your campaign in a location you can detail, such as a village, a neighborhood in a larger city, an outpost, or a roadside tavern. Be prepared to give players enough information about that location to help them figure out what ties, if any, their characters have to it. Once you have this campaign hub fleshed out, create one or two local attractions that might serve as adventure locations, such as a haunted house on the outskirts of town or a dungeon complex tucked in the nearby hills.</p>

            <p>If you're using a published campaign setting, pick any location in that setting and develop it as you like. A published setting or adventure might give you all the details you need. @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004#free-city-of-greyhawk]{The Free City of Greyhawk}, described later in this chapter, is an ideal starting location and illustrates the kinds of things to consider as you detail a starting location.</p>
            <p>If you're building your own setting, start small by detailing only this starting area. The rest of your setting can remain undeveloped for now. Don't spend too much time fleshing out the geopolitical landscape of your world or locations the adventurers aren't likely to visit right away; save those fun tasks for when you and your players have a better sense of where the campaign is headed.</p>

            <p>If you're using a published adventure to launch your campaign, use the character hooks in that adventure to bring the characters from their starting location to the adventure's action. Many campaigns begin with a published adventure and then develop organically as the characters explore beyond the scope of the adventure.</p>
            <p>If you're creating your own adventure for the start of your campaign, refer to the advice in @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003]{chapter 4}. Keep the first adventure relatively short and simple, allowing plenty of time for the characters to get to know each other as the players roleplay. What's most important is that they begin to feel like an adventuring party and get comfortable with their abilities. The full scope of the campaign can unfold to them later.</p>

        <p>A D&D campaign is like a garden. Each new adventure plants new seeds in the garden, which requires regular tending lest it run wild. Over time, your campaign will grow and flourish in ways you expected and in ways that will surprise you. You might need to weed out elements that aren't resonating with your players while planting new elements to tantalize them.</p>
        <p>Most D&D campaigns grow organically, rather than having all their elements set in stone from the get-go. From time to time, the characters' decisions will require you to improvise and create new campaign elements on the fly. For example, a new location might need to be developed to address the needs of the unfolding story, or certain NPCs might need fleshing out at a moment's notice. Other parts of this book, such as the "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#nonplayer-characters]{Nonplayer Characters}" and "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#settlements]{Settlements}" sections in @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 3}, can help you expand your campaign quickly.</p>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Episodes and Serials" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="590"><span class="entry-title-inner">Episodes and Serials</span></h2>
            <p>There are two basic ways to think about how adventures fit together in your campaign: as distinct episodes or as a serialized story. If you're not sure which type of campaign to run, ask your players what they prefer. If your players have different preferences, you can intersperse episodic, stand-alone adventures among serialized adventures to break up the bigger story.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Episodes" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="591"><span class="entry-title-inner">Episodes</span></h3>
                <p>An episodic campaign is a campaign in which the component adventures don't combine to form an overarching story. Episodic adventures are stand-alone quests, and the villains who appear in one adventure rarely resurface to trouble the characters again. If your game group plays infrequently, an episodic campaign might be ideal because the players can enjoy the current adventure even if they've forgotten the details of earlier adventures.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Starting a New Episode" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Starting a New Episode.</span> In an episodic campaign, the start of a new adventure doesn't necessarily have any connection to the end of the last one. The action might pick up immediately after the end of the previous adventure, but it might instead begin weeks, months, or years after the last adventure, allowing interim events to unfold while the characters take a break from adventuring.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="593"><span class="entry-title-inner">Serials</span></h3>
                <p>A serialized campaign is one continuous story broken up into smaller parts that flow naturally from one to the next. It often has one or more overarching threats, and the outcome of one adventure can affect how the rest of the campaign unfolds. If your game group meets regularly and often, a serialized campaign allows you to keep your players guessing what will come next as the campaign builds toward a satisfying conclusion.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Linking Adventures" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Linking Adventures.</span> In a serialized campaign, make connections between the end of one adventure and the start of the next to help it feel like a connected story. Sometimes you can simply continue the current storyline with new locations to explore and new threats to overcome. Alternatively, you can use the Adventure Connections table to inspire a link from one adventure to the next. The table suggests things you can do near the end of one adventure to lead characters into the next one.</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="597"><span class="entry-title-inner">Player Favorites</span></h3>
                <p>It's often easier to describe people and places that are hostile or frightening than it is to detail a feature you want characters to love. How can you know what rustic scene will make a character associate a place with home or what personality quirk will remind a character of their favorite mentor? You can ask a character's player directly, but instead consider handing over your narrative reins and letting a player describe the perfect detail.</p>
                <p>For example, say you have a peaceful village you plan to feature across several adventures. You hope the characters will connect with the place and treat it as home. As the characters enter the community, they smell something amazing. At this point, you could describe something you think smells good or something you think a character would like. Or you can ask a player, "The smell of something amazing drifts from around the corner. What is it?" Whatever the player's answer—cinnamon rolls from a nearby baker, firework charges being prepared for a celebration, or anything else—becomes part of the village, and the player has added an important detail to the location.</p>
                <p>You can use player input whenever you want to pinpoint something meaningful to the characters and their players. Consider asking players questions like these whenever you want to describe something in an impactful way:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">The tavern owner brings out your favorite dish—cooked to perfection. What's the dish, and what makes this one remarkable?</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">The curio shop is selling a trinket that reminds you of one of your family members. What's the trinket, and who does it remind you of?</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">The local children are playing a game you played in your hometown. What is it?</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">The young pickpocket reminds you of someone you once knew. Who?</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">From the animate mass of murderous dolls scrambles a figure that reminds you of your favorite childhood toy. What is it?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Questions such as these don't need to draw on warm memories. Having players describe what unsettles or disgusts their characters can make menacing encounters more impactful as well. In any case, take note of interesting character details that your players share, and record them in your campaign journal, as these details might be useful inspiration for later adventures.</p>

                <p>Adventurers are, by their nature, remarkable. Even at level 1, they perform miraculous deeds and possess qualities that set them apart from common folk. Reinforce this in your game. NPCs don't need to gush over the characters, but the characters' reputations as heroes, problem-solvers, or wonderworkers should be cemented early and develop throughout a campaign.</p>
                <p>During every session, look for opportunities to make the characters feel like the stars of the story, and try to answer one or more of the following questions:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">How are the characters the perfect people to solve a problem?</li>

                <p>It's easy to get caught up in a story with dramatic stakes, pitting characters against mounting threats. But every so often, at least once every three to five levels, give the characters a break—a low-stakes session or adventure that has nothing to do with the overarching plot or broader perils.</p>
                <p>A break episode can be an opportunity for the characters to reflect on the events of the ongoing campaign, explore the nuances of the world, and further develop the relationships between them in a more relaxed setting. Give the group space to breathe, note developments you want to highlight later, then continue with your adventures.</p>
                <p>Consider these ideas for a break episode.</p>

            <p>Most conflicts in a D&D campaign take weeks or months of in-world time to resolve. A typical campaign concludes within a year of in-world time unless you allow the characters to enjoy lengthy periods of quiet time between adventures.</p>
            <p>If you don't want to track the passage of days, weeks, and months, you might instead track the passage of time using seasons and seasonal festivals. The answer to the question "When does this adventure take place?" can be as simple as "in the winter" or "during the fall harvest festival."</p>

                <p>Extraordinary events coinciding with certain times of year make for great adventure opportunities. Perhaps a ghostly castle appears on a certain hill on the winter solstice every year, or every thirteenth full moon is blood red and fills werewolves with a particularly strong bloodlust. The appearance of a comet in the sky might portend all manner of significant events. The festivals of the gods can serve as opportunities to launch adventures, especially if the gods themselves are involved.</p>

        <p>A campaign's ending should conclude the last of the major conflicts and tie up most of the threads of its beginning and middle. (It's OK to leave some loose ends for characters to explore in the next campaign.) You don't have to take a campaign all the way to level 20 for it to be satisfying; wrap up the campaign whenever the story reaches its natural conclusion.</p>
        <p>Allow time near the end of your campaign for the characters to finish up any personal goals. Their stories need to end in a satisfying way, just as the campaign story does. Ideally, some of the characters' individual goals will be fulfilled by the final adventure. Give characters with unfinished goals a chance to finish them before the very end.</p>
        <p>Once your campaign has ended, a new one can begin. If you intend to run a new campaign for the same group of players in the same setting, using their previous characters' actions as the basis for legends is one way to invest your players in the new campaign. Let the new characters experience how the world has changed because of the actions or accomplishments of the previous campaign's characters. In the end, though, the new campaign is a new story with new protagonists. They shouldn't have to share the spotlight with the heroes of days gone by.</p>

            <p>Sometimes you run out of ideas for your campaign, or it gets so sidetracked that you have no idea how to bring it to a satisfying conclusion. You might just not feel excited about it anymore, or you might be so excited with ideas for a new campaign that you can't focus on the current one. Any of these might signal the end of your campaign.</p>
            <p>The best way forward when you want to end a campaign is to talk to your players about it. If you're not excited about the game anymore, it's quite possible they're not either, and you can change or end the campaign to everyone's satisfaction. Consider the following possibilities:</p>

        <p>Greyhawk is the invention of Gary Gygax, one of the D&D game's original creators. Gary based many of D&D's earliest adventures in this home-brewed setting. The version of Greyhawk presented here is largely based on <em>The World of Greyhawk</em> gazetteer, published in 1980.</p>

            <p><strong>Oerik</strong> (pronounced <em>or</em>-ick or <em>oy</em>-rick) is one of Oerth's continents.</p>
            <p><strong>Eastern Oerik</strong>, the vast region explored in this chapter, is home to many powerful nations and some of the D&D game's most famous dungeons and adventurers.</p>
            <p><strong>The Flanaess</strong> (pronounced flah-<em>nay</em>-ess or <em>flay</em>-nayz) is another name for Eastern Oerik and means "land of the Flan." The region's first human settlers and their descendants are known as the Flan.</p>
            <p><strong>Greyhawk</strong> is an independent city in Eastern Oerik that attracts large numbers of adventurers. Greyhawk doubles as the name of the campaign setting.</p>

            <p>The year is 576 CY (Common Year). Evil is ascendant across the lands of Eastern Oerik. If something isn't done to curtail the growing threat, Eastern Oerik will fall to tyrants, evil dragons, and monstrous hordes. Heroes are needed to bring hope to the people of the Flanaess. Even if the heroes die trying, the legends of their exploits will live on!</p>
            <p>Adventuring parties from the Free City of Greyhawk and other settlements trek across the vast wilderness of Eastern Oerik, slaying monsters and exploring dungeons to find magic items the adventurers can use to defend their homeland and take the fight to their enemies.</p>

                <p>Although Greyhawk lends itself well to any D&D adventure you might want to run, the default setting features conflicts with three major villainous groups: chromatic dragons, Elemental Evil cults, and Iuz and his followers. You can replace one or more of these conflicts with ones of your devising or with ones from the "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004#flavors-of-fantasy]{Flavors of Fantasy}" section earlier in this chapter.</p>
                <p>If you use these conflicts, look for opportunities in your adventures to introduce creatures in service to the three villainous groups. Give goals to these villains that bring their operatives into conflict with the player characters.</p>
                <p>The three major conflicts and the goals of the villainous groups are described below.</p>

                    <p>"Elemental Evil" is the name given to a host of destructive, extraplanar entities—demon lords, evil elemental princes, and elder gods—who ravaged the world of Oerth long ago. Many of these entities are now trapped in dungeons, with cults and monsters seeking to free and serve them.

The Temple of Elemental Evil (published in 1985) is set in the world of Greyhawk, in the Kron Hills between Verbobonc and Celene. It begins in the unremarkable village of Hommlet, with characters slowly discovering that agents of Elemental Evil have taken up residence in the nearby ruins and are working to rebuild their great temple. The rest of the adventure focuses on exploring the ruined Temple of Elemental Evil and dealing with the varied evil factions and forces within (including agents of Iuz, described below).</p>
                        <p><a href="https://5e.tools/adventure.html#PotA">Princes of the Apocalypse</a>, inspired by <em>The Temple of Elemental Evil</em>, presents an alternative arc for an Elemental Evil–themed campaign:</p>

The newly freed Iuz aims to lay waste to the kingdoms, steadings, temples, and outposts of his rivals. To that end, Iuz's spies are searching for powerful Artifacts they can use to ensure victory, while evil creatures spawn in Iuz's homeland and threaten neighboring realms.

Oerth has two moons: Luna (a great white moon, also called the Mistress) and Celene (a smaller blue moon, also called the Handmaiden). Greyspace's sun orbits Oerth, rather than the other way around.</p>
                <p>The sun takes 360 days to travel once around Oerth. Luna waxes and wanes in fixed cycles of 28 days each, upon which the months are based, while Celene follows a path that has full moons only four times each year, coinciding with four lunar festivals.</p>

                        <p>What does your campaign's calendar look like? The more your campaign calendar resembles the one that's familiar to you and your players, the easier it will be to remember and use. Familiar names for months and days of the week lend your campaign a wonderful simplicity that many players will appreciate. A calendar that uses ten-day weeks or names such as "Moonday" and "Coldeven" is harder for players to internalize but reminds them they're in a fantasy world. The Greyhawk calendar has twelve months and seven-day weeks like the Gregorian calendar, but gives unique names to months and days and introduces festivals that fall outside the calendar's months, giving it a fantastical feel.</p>

The membership of the Circle of Eight is secret but includes @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#mordenkainen]{Mordenkainen} (the strategist behind the group), @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#bigby]{Bigby}, @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#jallarzi-sallavarian]{Jallarzi Sallavarian}, @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#otiluke]{Otiluke}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#otto]{Otto}.</p>

                    <p>The order of the Knights of the Watch originated as a military force protecting the lands of Bissel, Gran March, Geoff, and Keoland from hostile neighbors to the north and west (particularly Ket and the Ulakandar). Though Watchers maintain strongholds along the border with Ket, most of their energy is spent defending against giants and dragons in the western mountains. The Watchers are sworn to an ascetic and disciplined code, and they train rigorously to the exclusion of personal property or other attachments.</p>

                    <p>The knights of the Order of the Hart were organized to preserve the freedom of the states of Furyondy, Veluna, and Highfolk against the threats of bandits and hostile neighbors. These nations have little centralized authority or military power, so the knights have historically served as a first line of defense against these varied threats. In recent years, they have mobilized against the rising threats of @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#iuz]{Iuz} and Elemental Evil, forcing them to broaden the scope of their operations into neighboring realms where these evils are active.</p>

                    <p>The Scarlet Order is a monastic order of Suloise militarists whose spies and assassins have infiltrated many courts and castles throughout the Flanaess, ready to strike. The leader of the order is a seemingly immortal being known as the Father of Obedience, Korenth Zan. He is rumored to be a Suloise monk who walked the lands of Oerik long before the Rain of Colorless Fire destroyed the Suloise Empire. Others claim Korenth is a red dragon—a former consort of @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#tiamat]{Tiamat} who became trapped in human form. Whatever the true story, the Father of Obedience is revered by all who pledge their lives to the Scarlet Order. His goals—and, by extension, the order's goals—are shrouded in mystery and could one day tilt the balance of power across the whole of Eastern Oerik.</p>

                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="634"><span class="entry-title-inner">Magic in Greyhawk</span></h3>
                    <p>In the world of Greyhawk, as in most D&D worlds, magic is widespread but still wondrous and sometimes frightening. People everywhere know about magic, and most people see evidence of it at some point in their lives. Magic permeates the cosmos and moves through the ancient possessions of legendary heroes, the mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched by the gods, creatures born with supernatural power, and individuals who study the secrets of the multiverse. Histories and fireside tales are filled with the exploits of those who wield magic.</p>
                    <p>What normal folk know of magic depends on where they live and whether they know people who practice magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet might not have seen true magic used for generations except the strange powers of the old hermit living in the nearby woods, which they regard with suspicion and mention only in whispers.</p>
                    <p>By contrast, magic is common enough in the Free City of Greyhawk that the Guild of Wizardry teaches magic and sells spellcasting services. Extensive codes of law govern the use and abuse of magic. The law treats magical coercion as a major crime, and punishes the public use of magic in situations that could harm people or property.</p>

                    <p>Eastern Oerik is a realm of many mysteries, several of which are described below.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bat-Folk of Hepmonaland</strong>. Separated from Eastern Oerik by the Tilva Strait, Hepmonaland is a relatively small continent that few people of the Flanaess known much about. Those who have explored the north spur of Hepmonaland report dense rainforests, severe tropical storms, steamy wetlands, and a fetid swamp (called the Pelisso Swamp). Adventurers are sometimes lured into Hepmonaland's rainforests by ancient ruins, including tombs and shrines left behind by an ancient civilization of bat-like humanoids whose history is largely forgotten.</p>
                    <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Devastating Magic" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                        <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Devastating Magic.</span> Almost a thousand years ago, the war between the Baklunish and Suloise empires came to a horrific end. The Baklunish people who lived in what is now the Dry Steppes called down a rain of colorless fire that burned all living things, ignited the landscape, and reduced the Suloise lands to ashes, creating the Sea of Dust. In retaliation, Suloise survivors invoked their own magic to devastate the Baklunish lands. What magic was responsible for the Rain of Colorless Fire and the Invoked Devastation? What would happen if such magic fell into the wrong hands today?</p>
                        <p>A central portion of the Dry Steppes, where the seat of the Baklunish empire stood, is said to remain pleasant and rich, roamed by Baklunish nomads. The former Suloise capital, by contrast, in the heart of the Sea of Dust, is beset by howling winds, terrible dust storms, and rains of volcanic ash and cinders from the nearby Hellfurnaces.</p>

                        <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Land of Black Ice.</span> Those who have ventured far north of the Burneal Forest tell of a strange phenomenon. Instead of normal stark-white snow and translucent blue-white ice, there is an endless landscape of deep-blue ice partially covered in snow. Strange arctic monsters prowl these fields of dark ice. Stranger still, a verdant land is rumored to exist beyond the ice, where the sun never sets.</p>

The harsh climate, wildly varying temperatures, and hostile inhabitants discourage exploration. Expeditions have attempted to penetrate the Bright Desert and extract its riches, but none have ever returned.</p>

                    <p>The Gods of Greyhawk table shows many of the most popular deities worshiped in the Flanaess. Greater gods and demigods are marked as such; the others are lesser gods. Many other deities and demigods are also worshiped in the Flanaess, beyond those shown on the table. Some deities of Greyhawk have also transcended their origin on this world to impact the broader multiverse. Two of these, @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#tharizdun]{Tharizdun} and @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#vecna]{Vecna}, are described in @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008]{appendix A}.</p>
                    <p>The greater gods of Greyhawk rarely get directly involved with happenings on Oerth. Lesser gods are more likely to manifest in some form on the Material Plane and interact with their worshipers. Cuthbert, for example, is well known for appearing in mortal guise, appearing as a dirt-covered farmer, a wanderer robed in brown and green, or an elderly tinker. And of the many quasi-deities that appear on Oerth, most prominent among them is Iuz, a demigod who rules his own nation in the Flanaess.</p>

            <p>Would-be heroes are drawn to the Free City of Greyhawk by promises of adventure. The city is rife with opportunities for peril and plunder.</p>
            <p>The city stands on the eastern banks of the Selintan River. The river flows south from the Nyr Dyv (the Lake of Unknown Depths) down to Woolly Bay and remains easily navigable for its entire length.</p>
            <p>Once a frontier hub of the Great Kingdom of Aerdy, Greyhawk proclaimed itself free and independent seventy-eight years ago, claiming the Selintan basin as its territory. Adventurers drawn to the nearby ruins of Castle Greyhawk have provided a steady influx of cash to the city in the years since.</p>

                    <p>There are ample places within the city and on the city's outskirts where adventurers can build Bastions (see @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000007]{chapter 8}).</p>

                    <p>Two of the three central conflicts of the Greyhawk setting—the threats of Elemental Evil and Iuz—are the source of major tension and intrigue in the Free City of Greyhawk. The third conflict, involving evil dragons, is a looming threat nearby, particularly in the Mistmarsh, the hills of the Abbor-Alz, and the Bright Desert.</p>

                    <p>Greyhawk has a frontier spirit atypical for a settlement of its size. The locals are a tough and rowdy lot. Adventurers seeking action don't need to look far, as the city contains more than its fair share of troublemakers.</p>

                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="652"><span class="entry-title-inner">Background Connections</span></h3>
                    <p>Use the backgrounds of the characters to connect them to people and places in the city. These connections help the players feel like Greyhawk is their characters' home—or will quickly become their new home. A character who was born and raised in Greyhawk might have known one of the city's prominent figures for many years, while someone who has just arrived in the city might have a mutual friend with that connection or might carry a letter of introduction recommending them to that person. (Each location detailed in the "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004#city-locations]{City Locations}" section includes potential connections for two character backgrounds.)</p>

                    <p>Greyhawk is an ideal place for activities that support adventuring. There's endless opportunity for social interaction in such a bustling place, as well as places where characters can rest and recuperate between adventures, acquire new adventuring gear, and spend their gold.</p>

                    <p>As a home base for characters, Greyhawk can serve as a place to live, train, and recuperate between adventures. As described under "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004#getting-players-invested]{Getting Players Invested}" in this chapter, Greyhawk offers a host of potential friends, rivals, villains, and resources. Use the people and locations mentioned in this chapter as a starting point for fleshing out characters' connections to the city, and work with your players to develop those connections. Choose one neighborhood of the city (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004#city-neighborhoods]{City Neighborhoods}" below) as a focus for the characters and their activities.</p>

                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="657"><span class="entry-title-inner">City Government</span></h3>
                    <p>The Free City of Greyhawk is ruled by a council called the Directing Oligarchy, made up of sixteen coequal rulers. This council elects its chief officer, the lord mayor—a position currently held by a human @creature[Spy Master|XMM] (Lawful Neutral) named Nerof Gasgol. The other directors include the captain-general and constable of the City Watch, several guild masters, priests of Boccob and Rao, the inspector of taxes, and a few influential magic-users with ties to politically active secret societies. Several of these directors represent criminal or unsavory interests, including Nerof Gasgol himself, who achieved his position and wealth as the owner of a notorious gambling den.</p>
                </div>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="City Watch" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="658"><span class="entry-title-inner">City Watch</span></h3>
                    <p>The City Watch is a standing garrison of some eight hundred @creature[Guard|XMM|Guards] and @creature[Warrior Veteran|XMM|Veteran Warriors]. Bolstering these defenders are @creature[Mage|XMM|Mages] from the city's Guild of Wizardry, as well as @creature[Priest|XMM|Priests] from local temples.</p>
                    <p>The captain-general and constable of the City Watch are stationed at the Grand Citadel (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004#city-locations]{City Locations}").</p>

                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="659"><span class="entry-title-inner">City Walls</span></h3>
                    <p>A 30-foot-high stone wall winds like a snake around the city. Two other walls, identical in height to the outer wall, separate the city into its three great sections. Access to the wall tops can be gained via lifts in each gatehouse. In addition, along the inside base of the outer wall are secret compartments at 300-foot intervals, each one containing a 30-foot-tall wooden ladder. All members of the City Watch know the locations of these secret ladders, which, in an emergency, can be pulled out and used by city defenders to quickly reach the parapets.</p>
                    <p>The walls are patrolled regularly. During daytime, the typical patrol is one sentry (a @creature[Guard|XMM]) placed every 300 feet along the top of the wall. At night, the guard patrol is quadrupled, with two sentries posted together every 150 feet along the wall. Also at night, torches light the wall top at 150-foot intervals between the guards so each sentry station is 75 feet from a torch in each direction.</p>

                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="City Gates" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="660"><span class="entry-title-inner">City Gates</span></h3>
                    <p>Each city gate consists of a pair of iron-reinforced wooden doors that can be barred from the inside. These heavy doors are backed by a massive portcullis of iron bars. A very small child might be able to squeeze between the bars, but not a youth or even an adult halfling. The city's portcullises are usually left open even when the gates are closed.</p>
                    <p>Each gate is contained within a small gatehouse flanked by a pair of towers. The tower tops and connecting blockhouse are equipped with arrow slits and holes for pouring boiling oil straight down onto invaders. Each gatehouse tower connects to the city through a door in its base and to the wall top by a door in its side. The towers contain three platforms, beginning at the top of the wall and extending upward. Each of these can shelter and provide a firing platform for up to forty archers.</p>
                    <p>Three of the city's gates typically remain open throughout the day and night: the Highway Gate (the grand entrance to the city), the Cargo Gate (used primarily by traders and merchants), and the Garden Gate (one of the city's two inner gates). The remaining gates are closed from dusk until dawn, and a visitor must produce a written message from the lord mayor of Greyhawk, the captain-general of the City Watch, or a head of state to be allowed through. In the latter case, the guards ensure the traveler is harmless before opening the gates.</p>
                    <p>Those passing through open gates aren't asked to explain their business, nor are they detained or turned back unless they are recognized as known fugitives. Wagons and carts might get searched if they trigger the guards' suspicions, but most vehicles are waved through without inspection. The guards keep a daily roster of who and what pass through their gates.</p>

                    <p>The city has temples and shrines dedicated to various gods. Religious practices that are certifiably evil aren't tolerated, however. When an evil sect is discovered in the city, its wealth is confiscated, its leaders are put to death, and all other members are banished from the city for life.</p>

The northern section is home to the High Quarter and the Garden Quarter, where the wealthiest folk of the city reside.

A red-bearded bear of a man with a prosthetic leg, Miklos is affable and proud.

                        <p>A many-towered fortress looms above all quarters of the city from its position atop a low rise. Its outer walls, darkened by soot and smoke, could use a good scrubbing.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>The grand edifice at the northern end of the High Quarter, simply called "the Citadel" by the city's inhabitants, contains barracks for the City Watch, the offices of the captain-general, the city's treasury, and a large store of armaments for the emergency citizen militia. The Citadel also contains a prison where the city's most hardened criminals are incarcerated.</p>
                    <p>The captain-general of the City Watch is Sental Nurev, a tall, human @creature[Warrior Veteran|XMM] (Neutral Good) with thinning blond hair and a mustache. Sental is usually incorruptible, but he is under great stress. The rulers of Stoink, a fortified town in the Bandit Kingdoms, have captured Sental's brother Sarek and are forcing the captain-general to provide information about Greyhawk's defenses and local politicians. Sental gives this information to a human @creature[Spy|XMM] (Chaotic Evil) who stays at the Black Dragon Inn under the false name Skanda Drond. Sental is unaware that the bandit lords of Stoink are pawns of Iuz, whose dreams of conquest extend to the Free City of Greyhawk and far beyond.</p>
                    <p>The city's constable—who serves as second-in-command to the captain-general, manager to the members of the watch, and a member of the Directing Oligarchy—is a compassionate @creature[Priest|XMM] of Pelor named Derider Fanshen (Neutral Good). Her kindness and talent for healing make her well loved among the watch, and as a former adventurer, she is sympathetic to adventurers' needs. She's unaware of Sental's compromised position.</p>

                    <p>Abra sits behind a high desk in the main hall. Six open archways lead from the main hall to wings where the bulk of the library's books are shelved, free for visitors to peruse (but not remove from the library). The library has several sages and scribes under contract to write books, mostly detailing current affairs in the city.</p>
                    <p>An iron door leads to a hallway behind the head librarian's desk. Three scribes (@creature[Mage|XMM|Mages]) labor here and act as sentries, for next to their desks are three locked, iron doors to the library's vaults. @spell[Arcane Lock|XPHB] spells seal these doors, beyond which are repositories for the library's most valuable or scandalous works. Next to each scribe's desk is a pull cord hanging through a hole in the ceiling. A tug on any one of these cords releases a homing pigeon from a loft above the library. It takes the bird 1 minute to find and alert an @creature[Archmage|XMM], who teleports to the main hall of the library to investigate.</p>

                    <p>Morley is one of the city's secret weapons, ready to repel invaders or break a siege should the need arise. The dragon has a soft spot for adventurers who risk their lives for good causes. He occasionally loans magic items free of charge to valorous heroes who can't afford them, on the condition that the items be returned to him as soon as they're no longer needed.</p>

                <p>To understand the Greyhawk of today (the year 576 in the Common Year), it is helpful to picture the Flanaess about 200 years ago. At that time, the Great Kingdom of Aerdy stretched from the Vast Swamp to the Rakers, and from the Solnor Ocean to the Yatil and Lortmil Mountains. Between the Lortmil Mountains and the Crystalmists was the Kingdom of Keoland, mimicking the Great Kingdom in its imperialist approach. To the west of the mountains, the Baklunish nations—survivors of the Invoked Devastation—stood much as they do now. And to the north, nomadic peoples (the Chakyik, the Wegwiur, the rovers of the Hunting Lands) and the North Kingdoms were, as now, independent of the politics of the south.</p>
                <p>The contraction of the two southern realms over the last two centuries is the primary force that has shaped the modern Flanaess. First, the provinces of Perrenland, Veluna, and Furyondy—far from the overking's throne in Rauxes—declared their independence from the Great Kingdom. When Nyrond joined them (in 356 CY), the stage was set for the slow disintegration of the Great Kingdom and the ongoing rebellion that dominates the eastern part of the Flanaess to this day.</p>
                <p>The beginning of Aerdy's decline marked the high-water mark of Keoland's expansionist policies, as it held sway from the Pomarj to the borders of Ket. Aided by Celene, rebels in the Ulek region strove to curb the kingdom's warlike ways, and the accession of King Tavish IV in 453 CY marked a dramatic shift in royal policy. The Yeomanry and the Ulek states were granted autonomy, the Gran March and Sterich became semi-independent while remaining loyal to the crown, and the diverse peoples of this region coexist in relative peace once again.</p>
                <p>With this big picture in mind, you can think of the Flanaess beyond the Free City of Greyhawk as five major regions, each with its own store of adventure possibilities waiting to be explored:</p>

                    <p>Greyhawk has a long history of ancient empires and more recent wars, but the only relevant details of this history are those that feature in your adventures. Highlight significant in-world details by revealing them in the course of your adventures. Use the following techniques to share lore with your players:</p>

                    <p>Seven years ago, knights and soldiers from Furyondy, the Archclericy of Veluna, the Viscounty of Verbobonc, and the elven kingdom of Celene formed an alliance to repel an evil horde that had gathered in the grassy fields south of the Velverdyva River. This clash of armies—arguably the greatest seen in Eastern Oerik—was called the Battle of Emridy Meadows. The forces of evil were smashed, and their remnants were driven back into the dungeons under their stronghold, the Temple of Elemental Evil. The forces of good, under the command of Prince Thrommel IV of Furyondy, besieged the temple, which fell in a fortnight. Only a few of the temple's wicked leaders escaped, and it is suspected that these individuals were responsible for the subsequent kidnapping of the prince.</p>
                    <p>Prince Thrommel was engaged to marry Lady Jolene, a priest from a prominent noble family of Veluna. Their marriage would have united Furyondy and Veluna as a single entity, with the canon of Veluna ruling in matters spiritual and the king of Furyondy ruling in matters temporal. This combined state, with its powerful elf allies in Celene, could wage a steady war against the evil plaguing Eastern Oerik. The prince's disappearance has stalled these plans.</p>

                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="698"><span class="entry-title-inner">The Rise of Iuz</span></h3>
                    <p>Iuz is the offspring of the demon lord Graz'zt and a human archmage named Iggwilv. For ages, he ruled the lands from the Howling Hills to Lake Whyestil, naming his domain after himself. These lands are so despoiled and dangerous that the otherwise fierce nomads of the Hunting Lands and Wegwiur pass through the Cold Marshes rather than enter the merest edge of Iuz's realm.</p>
                    <p>Iuz's evil reign was interrupted by a sixty-five-year imprisonment in the dungeon under Castle Greyhawk. During his absence, the Kingdom of Furyondy and its allies prospered, while the land of Iuz was overrun with evil bandits and monsters. Iuz's absence turned him into a legend and attracted a host of new followers, whose misplaced faith invested him with the power of a demigod.</p>
                    <p>Upon winning his freedom, Iuz had no trouble reclaiming his homeland. He forged tenuous alliances with the leaders of the Bandit Kingdoms and the Horned Society, whom he controls through terror. With their aid, he aims to destroy his neighbors and lay waste to the Free City of Greyhawk.</p>
                    <p>Since the resurgence of Iuz, the northern quarter of the Vesve Forest and the eastern part of the Howling Hills have become filled with marauders and monsters. While the Wegwiur battle Iuz's forces in the Howling Hills, scouts and troops from Furyondy join forces with Highfolk's defenders to drive out the Vesve Forest's evil inhabitants.</p>

                    <p>The culture of the Central Flanaess is a result of the long imposition of the Great Kingdom's rule over a variety of peoples living in close proximity. These peoples, by and large, share the Great Kingdom's practical, hardworking values, and they rely on the family and local community, rather than the might of nations and armies. They have a strong egalitarian streak unlike the Great Kingdom's strict social hierarchy, and (beyond the domains of Iuz and the Horned Society) they have little tolerance for would-be tyrants or aloof nobility. Amid a large number of free cities and confederations, the monarchies of Furyondy and Celene are far more democratic in practice than those in other regions.</p>
                    <p>Typical dress in the Central Flanaess includes a tunic of varying length, sometimes worn with close-fitting trousers. A cape or cloak, usually featuring patterns of ovals or diamonds, completes the ensemble. The cuisine of the Central Flanaess uses rice and potatoes alongside cheese and meat that is typically boiled or roasted.</p>

In the great inner tower of the keep, he hid his most prized possession: the Soul-Gem. Legend says this great white diamond fell from the sky and glowed with the brilliance of the sun, and its magic could drag mortal souls screaming from their bodies and trap them. The fortress was ruined long ago, but on foggy nights the great central tower still appears.</p>

In these caverns she conducted experiments and rituals to increase her powers. One of these rituals led to her downfall, though, when she accidentally freed the demon lord @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000005#layers-45–47:-azzagrat]{Graz'zt} from the prison where she had bound him. Though Graz'zt fled to the @UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000005#abyss]{Abyss}, Iggwilv was weakened and forced to abandon the caverns, but a secret cache of her treasure is said to remain. <a href="https://5e.tools/adventure.html#QftIS,6">The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</a> are detailed in <a href="https://5e.tools/adventure.html#QftIS">Quests from the Infinite Staircase</a>.</p>

                <p>Once a powerful force for order and good, the Great Kingdom of Aerdy has declined over the last century to a state of utter decadence. The reigning overking—Ivid V, patriarch of the House of Naelax—is rumored to have fiendish advisers as well as a noble court infested with evil. Ruling from the Malachite Throne in Rauxes, Ivid commands an unmatched army currently embroiled in two wars at once: one against the Kingdom of Nyrond and the Prelacy of Almor, and the other against the Iron League (consisting of Idee, Irongate, the Lordship of the Isles, Onnwal, and Sunndi). To pay for these costly wars, the overking has imposed heavy taxes on his subjects, further diminishing his popularity.</p>
                <p>Aerdiaak, Ahlissa, Medegia, and Rel Astra are provinces and fiefs of the Great Kingdom. The Sea Baronies are vassal states that provide most of the kingdom's navy.</p>

                    <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="707"><span class="entry-title-inner">Eastern Flanaess Culture</span></h3>
                    <p>The culture of the Eastern Flanaess is largely that of the ancient Aerdi tribe of humans that conquered the region and established the Great Kingdom almost 800 years ago. The Aerdi valued common sense, hard work, and knowing one's place in a strict social order. Having claimed their position of power through conquest, they put great emphasis on military power and martial skill. These values persist throughout the region, reinforced in the Great Kingdom by strict laws and even stricter social mores.</p>
                    <p>These same values persist in many of the lands resisting the overking's reign. Nyrond and Almor, in particular, share the stratified social structure of the Great Kingdom, with their king and prelate remaining distant from the common people they rule. The independent states of the Iron League are more egalitarian, sharing that trait with the peoples of the Central Flanaess.</p>
                    <p>Typical clothing in the Eastern Flanaess is a tunic of varying length, often worn with trousers, with a cape or cloak. The fabrics of the east are often patterned with checks or plaids, with different patterns often relating to the wearer's lineage. Eastern cuisine pairs rice and potatoes with a variety of meats, especially seafood.</p>

                    <p>The Duchy and County of Urnst bridge the regions of the Central and Eastern Flanaess. Once part of the Great Kingdom's province of Nyrond, they declared their independence from the Great Kingdom and the new Kingdom of Nyrond at the same time, achieving their separation from Nyrond with minimal bloodshed. While the people of Urnst distrust the king of Nyrond, they don't hate him like they do the overking.</p>
                    <p>The proximity of the Nyr Dyv, the Cairn Hills, and the Shield Lands means the Urnst lands can't ignore the rising threat of Iuz or the politics of the Free City of Greyhawk. At the same time, Nyrond stands as a buffer between Urnst and the Great Kingdom, but the overking's threat still looms. The duke and countess of Urnst believe that a united Urnst will stand more strongly against pressures from east and west, which they hope to achieve through the marriage of Countess Belissica Gellor to Byron Lorinar, eldest son of Duke Jalken Lorinar.</p>

                    <p>The story of the Eastern Flanaess is a tale of scrappy rebels—Nyrond, Almor, and the Iron League—defying the overwhelming power of a corrupt and decadent empire. This story lends itself to campaigns exploring themes of supernatural horror (in the fiend-haunted courts of the overking), swashbuckling (in the cities across the region as well as the eastern seas), and war (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004#flavors-of-fantasy]{Flavors of Fantasy}" in this chapter).</p>

                    <p>The Chakyik and Wegwiur—called Tiger Nomads and Wolf Nomads, respectively, by their neighbors—are horse riders of Baklunish descent who dwell on the steppes north of the Yatil Mountains and Lake Quag. The climate in the steppes and pine forests ranges from cool to frigid. Both peoples maintain scattered trading outposts that welcome visitors from neighboring and distant lands.</p>
                    <p>The steppe nomads have a rich storytelling tradition that reinforces a strong sense of clan identity and family line within the clan. Their tales include stories not only of heroes within their clans, but also of heroic horses, and the nomads trace equine lineages as carefully as their own. These nomads maintain the traditions of their people, many of which can be traced back to the ancient Baklunish empire.</p>
                    <p>The Baklunish nomads favor bright pastel colors in gowns and robes. When traveling or at war, though, they prefer more rugged gear of leather and hide.</p>

                    <p>Three kingdoms of related peoples occupy the Thillonrian Peninsula in the northeast of the Flanaess—a beautiful subarctic landscape of high mountains, coniferous forests, and deep fjords. The kingdoms are named for the three distinct tribal lines that inhabit them: the Cruski (whose name means "ice"), the Fruzti ("frost"), and the Schnai ("snow").</p>
                    <p>The Schnai are strong and numerous. When Queen Ingrid of the Schnai has a mind to raid the isles of the Sea Baronies or the coasts of Aerdiaak and the Great Kingdom, she calls upon the king of the Fruzti and the queen of the Cruski to join her army. King Hundgred of the Fruzti has no choice but to honor his oath to the Schnai, while Queen Tharla of the Cruski rarely turns down a chance to attack her enemies. At other times, the Cruski raid the Fruzti, the Schnai, or the Hold of Stonefist.</p>
                    <p>As their distinct kingdoms suggest, the people of the North Kingdoms value their connection to their clan lineage. They preserve a love of learning from their distant ancestors of the Suel Imperium, and they value knowledge of the natural world as highly as they do the skills of hunting, sailing, and warfare. Their clothing includes shirts and pants made of wool, augmented with furs, capes, mittens, and warm boots. They often wear large pins, brooches, or emblems in their cloaks as a sign of wealth or accomplishment.</p>

                    <p>The People of the Hunting Lands (called Rovers of the Barrens by their neighbors) have a history of raiding the outskirts of Furyondy, the Bandit Kingdoms, Tenh, and Wegwiur, which hasn't won them many allies. The nomads' legendary dominance of the north has faded, as the forces of Iuz and the Horned Society wage steady war against them while raiders from the Hold of Stonefist prey on the Hunting Lands farther east. Many of the Rovers' mightiest warriors—the Wardogs—have perished in battles against all these relentless foes.</p>
                    <p>The people of the Hunting Lands value a close connection to the natural world. They view nature as an entity to be respected, not controlled, and their myths and legends teach the value of accepting nature's bounty as a gift that evokes gratitude. They wear clothes made entirely of animal skins, including belts, capes, robes, and slippers, and decorate their skin with paints and tattoos.</p>

No single bandit lord is powerful enough to conquer the whole territory, and the combined strength of all is often required to defend against retaliation by neighboring states for the bandit lords' aggression. At least one of the bandit lords, Renfus the Mottled (ruler of Stoink), is wholly in the service of Iuz.</p>

Without the protection of the Great Kingdom, Ratik has been forced to defend itself against frequent raids from the North Kingdoms and the Sea Baronies, as well as attacks from mountain-dwelling monsters.

Several large battles between Wegwiur and the forces of Iuz have taken place in that area.</p>

                <p>Survivors of the Invoked Devastation that destroyed the ancient Baklunish empire settled the temperate prairies, forests, and coastal lands of the Western Flanaess about a thousand years ago. Largely separated from the rest of the Flanaess by the Yatils, the Barrier Peaks, and the Crystalmist Mountains, these realms are a stronghold of Baklunish cultures.</p>
                <p>The nations of Ekbir, Tusmit, and Zeif represent the heart of the region, and two rivers—the Blashikmund and the Tuflik—form natural borders between them. Although the nations currently enjoy peaceful relations, Tusmit profits by playing its political neighbors against each other—Ekbir against Zeif, Zeif against the Ulakandar nomads, the Ulakandar nomads against Ket, and so forth. Pasha Qharlan Sylba of Tusmit is careful to keep his name well clear of these schemes so he can avoid embroiling Tusmit in open warfare. But Tusmit's spies are currently causing discord by spreading rumors that Zeif is planning to invade Ekbir. Ekbir's sultan believes the rumors are true and is readying his army.</p>
                <p>Sultan Naxas Murad of Zeif is a reclusive man, a great philosopher, and a stern father figure to the rulers of Ekbir and Tusmit. Over the years, advisers and family members have urged Naxas to expand Zeif's borders through military conquest, but he refuses to do so, citing failed land grabs by kingdoms through history as proof that imperial expansion across the Flanaess rarely ends well.</p>

                    <p>The culture of the Western Flanaess preserves many of the ways and traditions of the ancient Baklunish empire. Enormous value is placed on the virtues of hospitality and generosity, particularly almsgiving and pious donations to temples and clergy. Since the fall of their ancient empire, the people of the Western Flanaess have demonstrated more interest in trade—as a way of amassing power and wealth, but also as a means of connecting and coexisting with neighbors—than in imperial expansion or military domination.</p>
                    <p>The clothing favored by the people of the Western Flanaess features bright patterns in vibrant colors, worn in flowing gowns, robes, and long coats worn with breeches. Their cuisine is renowned for its rich flavors and spiciness.</p>

                    <p>Ket is the crossroads between the Western Flanaess and the rest of the continent, nestled between the Yatil Mountains and Barrier Peaks. Though it was founded by Baklunish settlers, Ket's proximity to both Bissel (and the lands of Old Keoland) and Veluna (and the Central Flanaess) makes it a vibrant, multicultural land rich from extensive trade. Its culture reflects the breadth of its trade, including sizable populations of dragonborn and tieflings and displaying a fusion of Baklunish and Oeridian influence. This mixture is visible in the title of its ruler, which is a combination of a Baklunish title (bey) and an Oeridian one (graf). The beygraf is a noble chosen by the lords of Lopolla's wealthiest, most influential families. Many of these lords also serve as generals in the Kettish military. The current beygraf, Zoltana Lhaz, is a skilled diplomat who so far has balanced the interests of different forces both inside her nation and among her neighbors.</p>

                    <p>The political and mercantile intrigue among Ekbir, Tusmit, and Zeif provides abundant adventure opportunities for characters in the Western Flanaess. A campaign focused around intrigue or mystery (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.GBTtcihR9BUp8gFZ.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004#flavors-of-fantasy]{Flavors of Fantasy}" in this chapter) works particularly well in this region.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the Western Flanaess has its fair share of monsters, dungeons, and ruins as well. The ruins of the Baklunish Empire in the Dry Steppes, and those of the Suel Imperium in the Sea of Dust, attract plenty of adventurers as well as villains hoping to claim the magical knowledge that caused the terrible catastrophes leading to the fall of those empires. Ket and Ull, too, suffer from the depredations of the monsters in the Barrier Peaks and the Yatil Mountains, just as their eastern neighbors do.</p>
