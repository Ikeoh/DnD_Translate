    <p>Fundada por imigrantes de Chult e da Região de Vilhon, Boa Mead está situada entre Redwaters e uma floresta de pinheiros próxima. As habitações baixas da cidade, adornadas com esculturas de dinossauros e serpentes, são ofuscadas pela estrutura de dois andares do salão de hidromel, seus beirais esculpidos e pintados para se assemelharem a wyverns. Como o mel é o ingrediente chave do hidromel, a cidade literalmente vibra com o zumbido das abelhas.</p>
    <p>Todas as tavernas em Icewind Dale estão acostumadas a receber entregas regulares de hidromel, e a cidade não consegue produzir ou entregar seu hidromel rápido o suficiente. Todas as entregas foram interrompidas temporariamente, no entanto, porque um @creature[verbeeg marauder|IDRotF] (veja @UUID[JournalEntry.Znh97HN237fz3Yie.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}) emergiu da floresta três dias atrás e roubou três barris de hidromel que estavam sendo carregados em um trenó puxado por cães para transporte para Bryn Shander. Kendrick Rielsbarrow, o porta-voz da cidade e um gigante por seus próprios méritos, enfrentou o verbeeg e não se saiu bem. Depois de espetar Kendrick com sua lança, o verbeeg agarrou os barris e desapareceu de onde veio. Os outros residentes de Boa Mead tentaram salvar Kendrick, sem sucesso; seu corpo jaz em um santuário local. Cinco membros da milícia foram atrás do verbeeg, mas não retornaram.</p>

            <p><em>Purveyor of Good Mead's honey wine</em></p>
            <p>Four decades ago, this mead hall put an end to the town's dependence on knucklehead trout fishing with its famous honey wine, which quickly became popular throughout Ten-Towns.</p>
            <p>The mead hall has a large, fire-heated space dedicated to bee husbandry and the nurturing of beehives. The droning bees can be heard throughout the town, though most residents are so accustomed to the buzzing that they pay it no mind.</p>

                <p><span title="Page 72">p72</span></p>
                <p>Good Mead also needs a new leader, and two locals have emerged as contenders to replace Kendrick Rielsbarrow as town speaker. It will take a week or two for the town to plan an election. One candidate is a red-bearded shield dwarf logger named Shandar Froth, and the other is Olivessa Untapoor, a middle-aged woman who descends from the town's Chultan founders and who makes casks to hold Good Mead's famous brew.</p>
                <p>Shandar is wanted by the authorities in Mirabar for the murder of another dwarf. Zhentarim agents located Shandar a few years back and are blackmailing him into serving as their eyes and ears in town. Once a month, Shandar travels to Targos to brief Naerth Maxildanarr, its speaker, on everything that has transpired of late in Good Mead.</p>
                <p>Olivessa doesn't want to be town speaker, but her friends are pushing her to assume the role for the good of the town. She would be delighted to see someone else step up to challenge Shandar for the speakership.</p>
                <p>For more information on Olivessa and Shandar, see the "@UUID[.0000000000000008#new-town-speaker]{New Town Speaker}".</p>

            <p><em>Shrine of Tempus (god of war)</em></p>
            <p>This vacant building stands on the lakeshore and has a crow-haunted steeple protruding from its peak. Unlike the mead hall, which is well cared for, the shrine's painted icons of the god of war wielding a flaming sword are chipped and faded, and its spacious interior stands mostly empty except for a long table on which rests a body covered with a blanket. The body is that of Speaker Kendrick Rielsbarrow, a giant of a man in his forties. He died from three stab wounds to the chest.</p>
            <p>The shrine was built over a century ago, when the town's rivalry with Dougan's Hole raged so fiercely that the lake, a frequent battlefield, became known as Redwaters. For a time thereafter, nearly all residents of Good Mead paid homage to Tempus. Today, the shrine's relevance has dwindled to the point where it's mainly used just for town gatherings.</p>

        <h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="353"><span class="entry-title-inner">The Mead Must Flow</span></h1>
        <p>Taverns throughout Ten-Towns depend on deliveries of honey mead to satisfy their customers, and Good Mead needs the coin. Two days ago, a verbeeg (see @UUID[JournalEntry.Znh97HN237fz3Yie.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}) stole three casks of mead as they were being loaded onto a dogsled. When the town speaker tried to prevent the theft, the verbeeg killed him. The townsfolk want revenge, but more important, they want their mead back!</p>
        <p>If the characters undertake this quest, they must track the verbeeg to his lair, which he shares with a dopey ogre, some stolen livestock, and a sleepy brown bear. To complicate matters, the verbeeg's romantic interest—another verbeeg—arrives as the characters are leaving.</p>
        <p>How the characters learn of the town's travails depends on whether the adventure began in Good Mead or not. If Good Mead is the starting town for the adventure, the characters know all the information in the "@UUID[.0000000000000008#good-mead]{Good Mead}" section, which you can read to the players. If Good Mead is not the starting town for the adventure, characters become aware of the town's misfortunes when one or more locals put them up for the night.</p>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Getting the Quest" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="354"><span class="entry-title-inner">Getting the Quest</span></h2>
            <p>If the characters offer to retrieve the stolen casks, the locals can't reward them with much more than free lodging and drink for a tenday. If the characters accept these terms, various townsfolk can point in the direction the verbeeg went after stealing the casks.</p>
            <p>As the characters make their way to the edge of the forest, read:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                <p>A figure in cold weather clothing lurches out of the woods into plain view, running as fast as he can through the deep snow. Slung over his back are a pair of animal traps, one of which appears to contain a panicked fox.</p>
                <div class="float-clear">
                    <p></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The figure is Fef Moryn (chaotic good human @creature[scout]), a trapper. He was out in the woods checking his traps when he came upon a grisly scene: five members of Good Mead's militia, their skulls and chests stove in. He came straight home to alert the town.</p>
            <p>The characters can't convince Fef to return to the bodies, but they can follow his tracks through the snow easily enough.</p>
            <p>The @creature[fox|IDRotF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.Znh97HN237fz3Yie.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}) in Fef's trap is rattled but uninjured. If the characters want to buy it, Fef will sell it to them for no less than 1 gp. Although it's a wild animal, it remains docile while held. If the characters keep the fox with them, they will find it helpful in the next scene.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Carnage in the Woods" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">

            <p>Characters who follow Fef Moryn's trail eventually come to the grisly scene the trapper spoke of:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                <p>Deep in the woods, amid the snow-covered pines, you discover the remains of the five militia members, who look like they were clubbed to death. New-fallen snow has already begun to settle on their corpses.</p>
                <div class="float-clear">
                    <p></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>These five people pursued the verbeeg for a while and then fell prey to the verbeeg's ogre buddy, who stayed behind in the woods rather than trying to keep up with the verbeeg.</p>
            <p>The ogre killed all five humans with its greatclub and then headed for home. Characters can follow its tracks in the snow without a check. A successful [[/save ability=wis dc=12]] (&Reference[skill=Survival]) check identifies these tracks as belonging to a Large giant. Following these tracks leads the characters on a path through the woods until, after 8 hours, they come upon the verbeeg's lair.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="The Fox and the Chwinga" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="356"><span class="entry-title-inner">The Fox and the Chwinga</span></h3>
                <p>The characters have one encounter while they follow the ogre's trail. A @creature[chwinga|ToA] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.Znh97HN237fz3Yie.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}) pops out of the snow and hurls a wee snowball at the lead character in the party's marching order. Once it has the party's attention, it capers atop the snow.</p>
                <p>If the characters rescued the fox from Fef Moryn, the animal bolts toward the @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] if it's allowed to do so. The @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] bows before the fox and offers it a frozen berry, which the fox gobbles up. After that, the @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] and the fox become fast friends. The @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] mounts the fox, bestows a <em>charm of animal conjuring</em> or one of the new charms described in appendix C (see "<a href="https://5e.tools/rewards.html#blankhash,flstsource:idrotf=1">New Chwinga Charms</a>") upon the character it hit with the snowball, and rides off on the fox's back. (For more information on charms, see "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,7,supernatural%20gifts,0">Supernatural Gifts</a>" in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.) The characters can interrupt this scene if they want; the @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] won't bestow its supernatural charm, however, if events unfold any differently.</p>
                <p>If the characters don't have the fox or choose not to let it go, the @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] follows them all the way to the verbeeg lair, if permitted to do so, but won't venture inside.</p>

                    <p>The trail culminates at a rocky hillside with pines growing around its base. Set into the hill are three caves.</p>
                    <p>The frozen creek emerges from the west cave, which has a low-hanging mouth.</p>
                    <p>The center cave—an eight-foot-high passage hewn from the rock—is moderately blocked by a tight stand of conifers and two massive fallen logs.</p>
                    <p>The northeast cave has a big, yawning mouth, and flickers of light emanate from within. The tracks of your quarry head through this entrance.</p>

                    <p>A bonfire in the middle of this cave keeps it lit and relatively warm. The scent of roasting meat fills the air as a hunk of meat on a spit drips juices into the fire. Goats and sheep are held in a spacious animal pen enclosed by a crude wooden fence. Other features of the cave include a wooden cart with a broken wheel, two old crates, and two barrels.</p>

                </div>
                <p>If the characters make a lot of noise, the @creature[ogre] comes running from @UUID[.0000000000000008#v5.-stolen-mead-casks]{area V5} and the @creature[verbeeg marauder|IDRotF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.Znh97HN237fz3Yie.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}) approaches from @UUID[.0000000000000008#v9.-duhg-is-here]{area V9}, both arriving at the same time. They try to kill intruders on sight. If more than two intruders are visible, the verbeeg whistles for the cave bear, which arrives 3 rounds later from @UUID[.0000000000000008#v7.-cave-bears-lair]{area V7}.</p>
                <p>If it's close enough to the bonfire, the verbeeg can use his action to try to shove a creature into the flames (see "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,9,shoving%20a%20creature,0">Shoving a Creature</a>" in the combat chapter of the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB">Player's Handbook</a>). Any creature that enters the bonfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) fire damage. It also catches fire as it leaves the bonfire's space, taking 3 ([[/r 1d6]]) fire damage at the starts of each of its turns until an action is used to put out the flames engulfing it.</p>
                <p>Characters in a position to harm the verbeeg's goats and sheep (see "Animals" below) can use an action to threaten one or more of these animals and, with a successful [[/save ability=cha dc=10]] (&Reference[skill=Intimidation]) check, cause the verbeeg to cease hostilities and call off the ogre and the cave bear. Under such pressure, the verbeeg is willing to let intruders leave the lair without further incident, provided the animals in the pen are not harmed or taken.</p>
                <p>One crate is packed with straw, which the verbeeg feeds to the goats and sheep. The other contains ten large torches, which the verbeeg made out of wood and pitch. The barrels are half-filled with salt and pepper, which the verbeeg uses to season his meat.</p>

                    <p>The verbeeg acquired his livestock by robbing travelers on the Eastway. He considers these beasts his treasured pets and has given names to all of them. He has trained the ogre and the cave bear not to attack them.</p>

                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                    <p>A heavy snore comes from a fat, battle-scarred ogre sitting with its back against the west wall, its chin on its chest. A thin stream of drool trails from its mouth onto its bloodstained leather loincloth. On the floor at its feet is a bloody greatclub with tufts of hair and bits of metal stuck in it.</p>
                    <p>Suspended from the ceiling of this chamber by a series of ropes and pulleys are six baskets. Clustered near the south wall are three wooden casks carved with Good Mead's heraldic symbol: a drinking mug made of a cut-off section of horn, with an antler handle added, upright and centered.</p>

                <p>The @creature[ogre] can never remember its name, so the verbeeg calls it "Friend." It has fully recovered from its fight with the town militia. Any character who succeeds on a [[/save ability=dex dc=8]] (&Reference[skill=Stealth]) check can creep around in the cave without waking the ogre. The character must repeat the check after disturbing an object in the cave, such as a hanging basket or a cask of mead.</p>
                <p>If awakened, the ogre grabs its greatclub and attacks, shouting, "ME FRIEND!"</p>
                <p>The verbeeg rigged the system that supports the baskets to keep the ogre from tripping over them and to discourage the cave bear from rooting through them. Lowering a basket by using its mechanism requires an action. The baskets contain sheep shears, milk pails, bristle brushes, and several bags of grain and oats stolen from caravans on the Eastway. One of the baskets, determined randomly, contains the verbeeg's treasure (see "Treasure" below).</p>

                <p>If the cave bear has not been summoned elsewhere by the verbeeg, it sleeps in the western niche of this chamber until it detects intruders. It has brown fur and &Reference[rule=darkvision] out to a range of 60 feet. It otherwise uses the @creature[polar bear] stat block. A character who succeeds on a [[/save ability=dex dc=14]] (&Reference[skill=Stealth]) check can sneak around in the cave without waking the bear, but only in the dark. A light source bright enough to illuminate the bear also wakes it. The bear, whose name is Yogobor, is hungry and hostile. But if it is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer and the verbeeg is nowhere in sight, the bear tries to flee for its life.</p>
                <p>The bear's niche contains the gnawed skull and bones of a shield dwarf named Artin Glanhig (see @UUID[.0000000000000008#v3.-firelit-cave]{area V3}).</p>

Any character who succeeds on a [[/save ability=int dc=12]] (&Reference[skill=Religion]) check recognizes it as a depiction of Silvanus, a god of nature; the oak leaf is his holy symbol. The statue radiates an aura of abjuration magic when scrutinized with a @spell[detect magic] spell. An @spell[identify] spell can reveal its magical nature, but only if the caster is touching the statue when the spell is cast. Before the statue can be touched, the characters must dig through a foot of ice to reach it.</p>
                    <p>The statue blesses the pool, such that any creature that drinks from it gains the benefit of a @spell[greater restoration] spell. This magic is suppressed while the pool is frozen. A given creature can gain the pool's benefit only once.</p>

                <p>A verbeeg strides through the snow, approaching the mouth of the cave. Her misshapen face bears a too-wide smile. She clutches a spear in one hand while using her other arm to cradle a wicker basket filled with bits of shiny metal. "Duhg?" she shouts in Common. "You home?"</p>
                <div class="float-clear">
                    <p></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Gahg, a @creature[verbeeg marauder|IDRotF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.Znh97HN237fz3Yie.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}), has arrived for a romantic encounter with Duhg. Gahg has brought along some fragments of metal that she hopes will impress Duhg, who had been planning to give Gahg a cask of honey mead.</p>
            <p>If the characters try to stop Gahg from entering Duhg's lair, Gahg becomes alarmed, then enraged. She drops the wicker basket and attacks the characters, afraid that something terrible has happened to Duhg.</p>
            <p>If the characters run away, Gahg checks on Duhg to make sure he is unharmed, allowing the party a head start back to Good Mead. If the characters run back into the verbeeg lair and try to hide, Gahg searches for them after locating Duhg.</p>
            <p>If only one verbeeg survives contact with the characters, it won't rest until it has revenge for the death of its potential mate. A verbeeg is smart enough not to act rashly against the party, but it might vent its fury by launching more hit-and-run attacks on Good Mead.</p>

                <p>The metal fragments gathered by Gahg are pieces of a futuristic weapon that was jettisoned from the cargo hold of an illithid nautiloid before the spaceship crashed (see "@UUID[.0000000000000012#id-ascendant]{Id Ascendant}"). Gahg witnessed the crash, which looked like a comet streaking across the sky, then found the weapon's wreckage and took some of it. A character who examines the fragments and succeeds on a [[/save ability=int dc=20]] (&Reference[skill=Arcana]) check realizes that the metal is not something one could expect to find on this world.</p>

            <p>Once the characters find the two remaining casks of honey mead, they'll need to figure out a way to haul them back to Good Mead. After they solve that problem, they have a safe trip back to town. The townsfolk are happy to see the stolen mead returned but express concern if the characters left one or both of the verbeeg alive. After all, what's to stop them from terrorizing the town again?</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="378"><span class="entry-title-inner">New Town Speaker</span></h3>
                <p>As the characters are recuperating from their adventure or planning their next excursion, a local cask maker named Olivessa Untapoor (neutral good human @creature[commoner]) approaches the party leader, if there is one. If no character has assumed that role, Olivessa approaches the character with highest Charisma score:</p>
                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                    <p>A middle-aged woman approaches you and removes her thick wool scarf so that she can speak clearly. "My name is Olivessa, and I make the casks for the mead. Some friends of mine don't want Shandar Froth to become our next town speaker. They say he's untrustworthy. I don't know him that well, but I've been urged to run against him. I have no interest in the speakership, but you seem to be a good leader, and this town could use one. What do you say?"</p>
                    <div class="float-clear">
                        <p></p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Olivessa is ready and willing to throw her support behind any character who runs in the election for the speakership, and since she's a leading candidate herself, her support carries weight. Her opponent, Shandar Froth (neutral shield dwarf @creature[commoner]), doesn't like this turn of events. After accusing the characters of having no stake in Good Mead's future, he leaves town for a day to get help (see "Zhentarim Intervention" below).</p>
                <p>A character who spends at least 1 hour making inquiries throughout town can learn the following information about the two leading candidates for the speakership:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">Olivessa has deep roots in Good Mead. Her family has lived in the town since its founding. She's quite reserved and doesn't have any family of her own. She lives alone in the house closest to the Shrine of the Flaming Sword.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Shandar has lived in Good Mead for a few years and is popular among the town's loggers. He can be a bully and a blowhard, but there's nothing he wouldn't do for his friends. He lives with five other loggers in a small house on the west side of town.</li>
                </ul>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Zhentarim Intervention" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Zhentarim Intervention.</span> Shandar is under the thumb of Naerth Maxildanarr, the speaker of Targos. Faced with the possibility of losing the election, Shandar makes the 8-hour hike to Targos to warn Naerth and then promptly returns home. A day later, eight human @creature[Thug||thugs] storm the mead hall in cold weather clothing. Before the characters can intervene, Shandar and his fellow loggers confront the thugs and kick them out of town with their tails between their legs. The whole incident is orchestrated to make Shandar into a local hero. Characters who capture and interrogate one or more of the thugs learn that Naerth Maxildanarr hired them.</p>
                    <p>If the characters fail to expose the deception, Shandar is elected town speaker, giving the Zhentarim a political foothold in Good Mead.</p>
