When an adventurer dealt a mortal blow to Ashardalon's heart, the dragon replaced the injured organ with the balor. Ashardalon's features then took on a fiendish cast, and his eyes now glow with demonic flame.

        <p>Before she changed her name and conquered enough of Eastern Oerik (the Greyhawk setting) to rightfully call herself the Witch Queen of Perrenland, Iggwilv <em>(IGG-wilv)</em> was known as Tasha, a human mage who began her career as the apprentice of Zagig Yragerne (see @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#zagyg]{Zagyg}). Later, as an adventurer, she created several new spells, including @spell[Tasha's Hideous Laughter|XPHB] and @spell[Tasha's Bubbling Cauldron|XPHB], leaning on the teachings of her adoptive mother, the arch-hag @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#baba-yaga]{Baba Yaga}. As Tasha grew in power and made powerful enemies, she changed her name to Iggwilv. In this guise, she became enchanted with the power of the Abyss and wrote the definitive treatise on demonkind: the @item[Demonomicon of Iggwilv|XDMG] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#demonomicon-of-iggwilv]{chapter 7}). She also bound and trapped the demon lord @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000005#layers-45–47:-azzagrat]{Graz'zt} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000005#layers-45–47:-azzagrat]{chapter 6}).</p>
        <p>Iggwilv ruled Perrenland as a tyrant. When Graz'zt escaped his magical prison, Iggwilv went into hiding. Iggwilv's current location is unknown, but she left behind a cambion son (@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#iuz]{Iuz}), who has his mother's tyrannical bent, and a daughter (Drelnza), who is now a vampire and lairs in the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004#greyhawk-gazetteer]{Greyhawk Gazetteer}" in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004]{chapter 5}), not far from her mother's old haunts.</p>

A reclusive and cantankerous archmage named Halaster Blackcloak claims Undermountain as his domain, although his overlordship isn't widely acknowledged by the dungeon's other denizens.</p>

Several of the older and more seasoned mages of Waterdeep consider Vajra an upstart, but they are smart enough not to challenge her. As the badge of her office, she carries the <em>Blackstaff</em>, an Artifact that holds the spirits of all her predecessors.</p>

        <p>Vecna <em>(VECK-nah)</em> had humble beginnings in the Greyhawk setting, where an order of Wizards used him as a bootblack and scribe. He studied magic in secret until he amassed enough power to slaughter the order, and then he turned his efforts toward scribing the @item[Book of Vile Darkness|XDMG] (described in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#book-of-vile-darkness]{chapter 7}). Armed with that dread tome, he forged a kingdom to rule, with the vampire @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000008#kas-the-betrayer]{Kas} as his lieutenant. But Kas betrayed and killed him, leaving only one hand and one eye intact (the @item[Eye and Hand of Vecna|XDMG] are described in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#eye-and-hand-of-vecna]{chapter 7}).</p>
        <p>Vecna's evil will was so great that he persisted beyond death and eventually became a demigod of secrets and evil magic. His ambition drives him to pursue greater divine power across the multiverse.</p>
