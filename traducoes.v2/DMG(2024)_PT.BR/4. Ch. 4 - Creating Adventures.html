    <p>Whether you're creating your own adventures or using published ones, this chapter helps you create fun and memorable experiences for your players.</p>
    <p>Creating an adventure involves blending scenes of exploration, social interaction, and combat into a unified whole that meets the needs of your players and your campaign. The basic elements of good storytelling should guide you throughout this process, joining the encounters into a coherent story.</p>

            <p>A published adventure includes a pregenerated scenario with the maps, NPCs, monsters, and treasures you need to run it. This allows you to focus your preparation time on plot developments that arise from the characters' actions.</p>
            <p>You can adjust a published adventure so it better suits your campaign and appeals to your players. For example, you can replace the villain of an adventure with one the players have already encountered in your campaign, or add details from your campaign setting so the adventure involves your players' characters in ways that the adventure's designer never could have imagined.</p>
            <p>Published adventures also provide inspiration for your own adventures. You can even take a part of an adventure and incorporate it into a different one. For example, you might use a map of a temple but repopulate it with monsters of your choice, or you might use a chase sequence as a model for a pursuit scene in your campaign.</p>

    <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Lay Out the Premise" class="rd__b  rd__b--0">
        <h1 class="rd__h rd__h--0" data-title-index="429"><span class="entry-title-inner">Lay Out the Premise</span></h1>
        <p>An adventure shares many of the features of a novel, a movie, an issue of a comic, or an episode of a TV show. Comic series and serialized TV dramas are particularly good comparisons because of the way individual adventures are limited in scope but blend together (to some degree) to create a larger narrative. If an adventure is a single episode or season of a series, a campaign is the series as a whole.</p>
        <p>But while it's worthwhile to compare an adventure to these other forms of storytelling, remember that an adventure isn't a complete story until you play it. Your players are coauthors of the story with you, and the events of the story shouldn't be predetermined; the actions of the players' characters have to matter. For example, if a major villain shows up before the end of the adventure, the adventure should allow for the possibility that the heroes defeat that villain. Otherwise, players can feel as if they've been railroaded—set onto a course that has only one destination or outcome, no matter how hard they try to change it.</p>
        <p>You might find it helpful to think about an adventure not as a narrative that arcs from beginning to end with little chance for deviation, but more in terms of situations that you are presenting to the characters. The adventure unfolds organically from the players' responses to the situations you present.</p>
        <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset" data-roll-name-ancestor="Guide Rails and Railroads">
            <h4 class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="430"><span class="entry-title-inner">Guide Rails and Railroads</span><span class="ve-flex-vh-center"> </span><span title="Page 106">p106</span></h4>
            <p>Players need to feel like they're in control of their characters, the choices they make matter, and what they do has some effect on the outcome of the adventure and on the game world. Keep that in mind as you're planning adventures. If your adventure relies on certain events, plan for multiple ways they might come about, or be prepared for clever players to prevent those events from happening as you expect. Otherwise, your players might end up feeling railroaded.</p>
            <p>On the flip side, players sometimes willfully disregard the adventure hooks you put in front of them and go entirely off the rails. See "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000000#respect-for-the-dm]{Respect for the DM}" in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000000]{chapter 1} and "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003#draw-in-the-players]{Draw In the Players}" later in this chapter for advice about dealing with this situation.</p>
            <p>One way to give players impactful choices is to keep multiple adventure possibilities available to them at the same time. If the characters have two or three things they can investigate or pursue, they have a meaningful choice. And if whatever threads they don't investigate turn into bigger problems, you've clearly demonstrated that their decisions matter.</p>

        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Adventure Premise" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="431"><span class="entry-title-inner">Adventure Premise</span></h2>
            <p>One way to start brainstorming an adventure is to imagine a situation that might pique the characters' interest. For some D&D players, a rumor of a dungeon filled with treasure is enough of a premise to launch an adventure. A brewing war between two small nations, the death of a leader and the accession of a new one, a migration of dangerous monsters, the appearance of a comet, and the opening of a portal to another plane of existence are other situations that could lead to adventure.</p>
            <p>A simple premise might also boil down to "a magic item that the characters want is hidden away in a dungeon." Browsing the magic items in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006]{chapter 7} can inspire you to create a simple adventure seed.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Adventure Conflict" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="432"><span class="entry-title-inner">Adventure Conflict</span></h2>
            <p>A premise can be a good starting point, but before you can turn it into an adventure, it needs a conflict worthy of the heroes' attention. The conflict might be driven by a single villain or monster, a villain with lackeys, an assortment of monsters, or an evil organization. But it need not involve the forces of evil; it could be a rivalry or disagreement between two families, organizations, or nations; a looming natural (or magical) disaster; or even conflict within the adventuring party about how to pursue the characters' goals.</p>
            <p>Given a premise of a dungeon filled with treasure, what conflict awaits the characters when they enter the dungeon? That might be as simple as "hostile monsters want to eat the characters" or "two rival factions of monsters inhabit the dungeon." It might also involve a rival or a villain hoping to plunder the dungeon first, a rumbling volcano threatening to erupt and bury the dungeon, or two rival families claiming ownership of the treasure left behind in the dungeon by their ancestors.</p>
            <p>If you're stuck, browse through the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#XMM">Monster Manual</a> until you find a monster that inspires you.</p>

            <p>Use the tables in this section to inspire adventure ideas for characters of different levels, with the range of possible levels grouped into four tiers. You can roll on the tables and see if the result sparks your imagination or read the entries on the tables until you find something that grabs you.</p>

                <p>The fate of a village might depend on the abilities of fledgling adventurers. These characters navigate dangerous terrain and explore haunted crypts, where they might fight ferocious wolves, giant spiders, evil cultists, flesh-eating ghouls, and ruthless brigands.</p>

            <p>Many D&D adventures revolve dungeons—interior spaces such as great halls and tombs, subterranean monster lairs, mazes riddled with traps, natural caverns extending for miles beneath the surface, and ruined castles. The "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#dungeons]{Dungeons}" section in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 3} can help you craft a dungeon environment for an adventure.</p>
            <p>Of course, not every adventure takes place in a dungeon. A wilderness trek across the desert or a harrowing journey into the jungle can be an exciting adventure in its own right. Outdoors, dragons wheel across the sky in search of prey, fierce warriors pour forth from grim fortresses to wage war against their neighbors, ogres and trolls plunder farmsteads for food, and monstrous spiders drop from web-shrouded trees.</p>
            <p>Adventures can also take place in cities, towns, and villages, which are often no less dangerous than dungeons or the wilds. The "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#settlements]{Settlements}" section in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 3} can help you create a settlement where an adventure can take place.</p>

                <p>When you're preparing an adventure to run for your friends, you don't need to write hundreds of pages describing each location in exhaustive detail. You can run a game with no more written notes than you'll find in one of the short adventures at the end of this chapter.</p>

                <p>An adventure location almost always benefits from a map, and the more thoughtfully constructed the map is, the more fun players are likely to have as their characters explore the location.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Maps and Adventure Structure" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Maps and Adventure Structure.</span> An adventure map can take many forms—from a detailed dungeon map that shows the dimensions and contents of every room to a rough outline of how one encounter might lead to another, depending on the route the characters choose. Whatever form your map takes, it functions as a flowchart since each decision point (a branch in a corridor, a room with multiple exits) leads to new decision points. If the characters leave a room by the north door, you check your map and determine it leads them into the great hall, lined with pillars, where the fire giant king holds court. If they leave by the secret door to the southeast, you check the map and follow the secret tunnel as it winds to the hidden vaults below the great hall.</p>

                <p>An inhabited adventure location has its own ecosystem. The creatures that live there need to eat, drink, breathe, and sleep. Predators need prey, and intelligent creatures search for lairs offering the best combination of air, food, water, and security. Keep these factors in mind when designing an adventure location. If the site has an internal logic, adventurers can use their understanding of that logic to make informed decisions.</p>
                <p>For example, characters who find a pool of fresh water in a dungeon might infer that many of the creatures inhabiting the dungeon come to that spot to drink. The adventurers might set an ambush at the pool. Likewise, closed or locked doors can restrict the movement of some creatures. A dungeon infested with carrion crawlers or stirges would need open passages so that these creatures can move about to find food.</p>

                <p>The monsters in any adventure location are more than a collection of random creatures that happen to live near one another. Fungi, natural animals, scavengers, and predators can coexist in a complex ecology, alongside sapient creatures who share living space through some combination of negotiation and domination.</p>
                <p>Each creature's entry in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#XMM">Monster Manual</a> indicates the terrain types where that creature is most often found, and that book also includes tables listing the creatures commonly found within each type of terrain. Using that information, you can decide which creatures inhabit an adventure location within a particular environment. You can choose a range of creatures, from common vermin to sapient inhabitants and terrifying predators, and decide how they live together.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Factions" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Factions.</span> Particularly in larger areas, groups of creatures might compete for resources. When these groups consist of sapient creatures, opportunities abound for the adventurers who enter those areas. Characters might ally with one group or play groups against each other to reduce the threat of the more powerful monsters. For example, in a dungeon inhabited by mind flayers and the grimlocks they rule, the adventurers might try to incite the grimlocks to revolt against the mind flayers.</p>
                    <p>Bring the NPC leaders of groups to life as described in the "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#nonplayer-characters]{Nonplayer Characters}" section in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 3}, fleshing out their personalities and goals. Then use those elements to decide how those leaders respond to adventurers.</p>

        <p>If an adventure situation directly affects the characters or the people and places they care about, that is often enough motivation for the characters to get involved. (However, see "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000000#respect-for-the-players]{Respect for the Players}" in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000000]{chapter 1} for advice about harming the people and places characters love.)</p>
        <p>If the adventure situation doesn't have an obvious impact on the characters or the people or things they care about, you can use other techniques to draw in the players. These are best tailored to the motivations of your players and their characters. For example, some adventuring groups are noble heroes who respond without hesitation to the pleas of innocent villagers crying for help; other groups are hardened mercenaries who respond only to offers of payment. Some groups are devoted to gods, rulers, or other patrons who might send them on quests, either directly or through intermediaries.</p>

            <p>Many adventures begin with a patron asking the characters to undertake a quest or mission, offering a reward in exchange for this service.</p>
            <p>Take the time to flesh out an NPC who serves as a patron. Once in a while, it can be interesting for the characters' patron to betray them. Pulling that trick more than once in a campaign, though, is likely to make the players unwilling to trust any future patrons and possibly suspicious about any adventure hooks you put in front of them.</p>

        <p>Encounters are the individual scenes in the larger story of your adventure. Reduced to fundamentals, an encounter is an objective with an obstacle. It accomplishes one or more of the following:</p>
        <ul class="rd__list">
            <li class="rd__li ">Moving characters closer to achieving a goal</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">Frustrating the characters' progress toward a goal</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">Revealing new information</li>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="453"><span class="entry-title-inner">Character Objectives</span></h2>
            <p>The following objectives can be foundations for encounters. Although these objectives focus on a single encounter during an adventure, using the same objective in multiple encounters allows you to combine these encounters into a larger obstacle or problem the adventurers must overcome.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Make Peace" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="454"><span class="entry-title-inner">Make Peace</span></h3>
                <p>The characters must convince two opposing groups (or their leaders) to end the conflict that embroils them. As a complication, the characters might have enemies on one or both of the opposing sides, or some other group or individual might be instigating the conflict to further its own ends. An encounter aimed at making peace might involve only social interaction, perhaps with the threat of combat if negotiations go poorly. It could also begin as a combat encounter, with the characters trying to stop the fighting and get the parties talking to each other.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Protect an NPC or Object" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="455"><span class="entry-title-inner">Protect an NPC or Object</span></h3>
                <p>The characters must act as bodyguards or protect some object in their custody. As a complication, an NPC under the party's protection might be cursed, panicked, unable to fight, or apt to risk the lives of the adventurers through dubious decisions. The object the adventurers have sworn to protect might be sentient, cursed, or difficult to transport. Such an encounter might be a combat encounter or an exploration encounter, with either @variantrule[Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile] monsters or a dangerous environment threatening the NPC or object the characters are trying to protect. If the characters are protecting an NPC, this objective can add an element of social interaction to a combat or exploration encounter.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Retrieve an Object" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="456"><span class="entry-title-inner">Retrieve an Object</span></h3>
                <p>The adventurers must gain possession of a specific object in the area of the encounter, often with a time limit. This might be a combat encounter, with monsters protecting the object, or an exploration encounter, with traps or hazards preventing access to the object. As a complication, enemies might desire the object as much as the adventurers do, adding a combat element to an exploration encounter or complicating a combat.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Run a Gauntlet" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="457"><span class="entry-title-inner">Run a Gauntlet</span></h3>
                <p>The adventurers must pass through a dangerous area. As with retrieving an object, reaching the exit is a higher priority than killing opponents in the area. A time limit adds a complication, as does a decision point that might lead characters astray. This might be an exploration encounter, with traps and hazards as complications, or a combat encounter against @variantrule[Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile] monsters.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Sneak In" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="458"><span class="entry-title-inner">Sneak In</span></h3>
                <p>The adventurers need to move through the encounter area without their enemies noticing. This is typically an exploration encounter, but if the characters are detected, a combat encounter or social interaction might result.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Stop a Ritual" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="459"><span class="entry-title-inner">Stop a Ritual</span></h3>
                <p>The plots of evil cult leaders, malevolent spellcasters, and Fiends often involve rituals that must be foiled. In a combat encounter, characters might have to fight their way through evil minions before attempting to disrupt the ritual's magic. This could also drive an exploration encounter, where the challenge is getting to the place where the ritual is occurring, or a social interaction encounter, where the objective is convincing the ritual leaders to stop their rite. As a complication, the ritual might be close to completion when the characters arrive, imposing a time limit. The ritual's completion might have immediate consequences, too.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Take Out a Single Target" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="460"><span class="entry-title-inner">Take Out a Single Target</span></h3>
                <p>A villain the characters seek to defeat is surrounded by minions powerful enough to kill the adventurers. The characters can flee and hope to confront the villain another day, or they can try to fight their way through the minions. As a complication, the minions might be innocent creatures under the villain's control. Killing the villain means breaking that control, but the adventurers must endure the minions' attacks until the villain falls.</p>

            <p>Make sure your players have clear objectives they can pursue at every stage of the adventure. Three simple techniques can ensure that the players understand the task at hand and how to pursue it:</p>
            <ul class="rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle">
                <li class="rd__li ">
                    <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Adviser NPCs"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Adviser NPCs.</span> A helpful NPC in a social interaction can offer advice and suggestions to the characters. Such an NPC might be the patron who initially sent the characters on the adventure, someone they met along the way, or a character's contact. When you're planning an adventure, include NPCs who can fill this role.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="rd__li ">
                    <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Evil Intrusion"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Evil Intrusion.</span> If things start grinding to a halt, have the characters encounter a minion or monster connected to the adventure's main threat. At the end of the encounter, perhaps the characters find information that gets them back on track. Plan one or two encounters like this ahead of time.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="rd__li ">
                    <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="The DM&#x27;s Role"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">The DM's Role.</span> If the characters can't figure out how to solve an encounter or aren't sure what to do next, you can remind the players of things their characters have already learned or call for Intelligence (&Reference[skill=Investigation]) or similar checks to see if their characters can remember and connect things that the players might be missing.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Something for Everyone" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="462"><span class="entry-title-inner">Something for Everyone</span></h2>
            <p>As described in the "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001#know-your-players]{Know Your Players}" section in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001]{chapter 2}, players have different tastes in the activities they enjoy in the game. An adventure needs to account for the different players and characters in your group to draw them into the story.</p>
            <p>An adventure that includes a balance of exploration, social interaction, and combat is likely to appeal to a wide breadth of players. But an adventure you create for your home campaign doesn't have to appeal to every possible player interest—only to the players at your table.</p>
            <p>You can design encounters that appeal to multiple player motivations. Imagine a fight pitting the characters against a gang of gnolls, delighting the players who enjoy fighting. Then a young dragon wanders into the middle of the fight. Suddenly the fight can swing one of two ways: the dragon could help the gnolls against the party or help the party against the gnolls. It's up to the players who thrive on acting to persuade the dragon to help the party.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="463"><span class="entry-title-inner">Multiple Ways to Progress</span></h2>
            <p>Make sure there are multiple ways the characters can progress through the adventure at any point, so if they miss one way, they have an alternative. Plan opportunities for the adventure to move forward even when the characters fail. Use challenges with a single path to success only as chances for the characters to obtain extra rewards.</p>

            <p>An encounter centered on exploration might involve the characters trying to disarm a trap, find a secret door, or discover something about the adventure location. An exploration encounter could also involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or traversing vast caverns.</p>

When you add a creature to your combat encounter, deduct its XP from your XP budget to determine how many XP you have left to spend. Spend as much of your XP budget as you can without going over.

                <p>When creating and running combat encounters, keep the following in mind.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Many Creatures" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Many Creatures.</span> The more creatures in an encounter, the higher the risk that a lucky streak on their part could deal more damage to the characters than you expect. If your encounter includes more than two creatures per character, include fragile creatures that can be defeated quickly. This guideline is especially important for characters of level 1 or 2.</p>

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Adjustments.</span> A player's absence might warrant removing creatures from an encounter to keep it at the intended difficulty. Also, die rolls and other factors can result in an encounter being easier or harder than intended. You can adjust an encounter on the fly, such as by having creatures flee (making the encounter easier) or adding reinforcements (making the encounter harder).</p>
                </div>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="CR 0 Creatures" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">CR 0 Creatures.</span> Creatures that have a CR of 0, particularly ones that are worth 0 XP, should be used sparingly. If you want to include many CR 0 critters in an encounter, use swarms from the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#XMM">Monster Manual</a> instead.</p>
                </div>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Number of Stat Blocks" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Number of Stat Blocks.</span> The best combat encounters often pair one kind of creature with another, such as fire giants paired with hell hounds. Be mindful of the number of stat blocks you need to run the encounter. Referencing more than two or three stat blocks for a single encounter can be daunting, particularly if the creatures are complex.</p>
                </div>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Powerful Creatures" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Powerful Creatures.</span> If your combat encounter includes a creature whose CR is higher than the party's level, be aware that such a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to take out one or more characters. For example, an @creature[Ogre|XMM] (CR 2) can kill a level 1 Wizard with a single blow.</p>

                <p>If an encounter involves a significant individual, use the guidance in the "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#nonplayer-characters]{Nonplayer Characters}" section of @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 3} to flesh out the details of that individual's personality and aims. For a group of nameless monsters, you can decide on a personality based on the monsters' entries in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#XMM">Monster Manual</a>, or you can use the Monster Personality table to inform how you portray the monsters and their actions. It's simplest to assign the same personality traits to an entire group of monsters in an encounter. For example, one bandit gang might be an unruly mob of braggarts, while the members of another gang are always on edge and ready to flee at the first sign of danger.</p>

                <p>Encounters with groups of monsters can be more interesting if rivalries, hatreds, or attachments exist among the monsters in the group.

On the other hand, a monster might flee if its hunting companion is killed, or a mistreated toady might be eager to surrender and betray its boss in return for its life.

                <p>A great way to make an adventure location feel alive—particularly an organized base or stronghold—is to allow its denizens to react to the presence of the adventurers. Once they are aware of trespassers, sapient creatures might either fortify their own locations or leave those locations to assist colleagues and expel the invaders.</p>
                <p>Take a copy of the adventure map, and pencil in the locations of all its inhabitants to give yourself a sense of where they're located relative to each other. When the adventurers engage in combat or any other noisy activity, assume that nearby creatures hear the noise and are alerted to the adventurers' presence. (Creatures that can't hear might be alerted by vibrations or other sensory cues.) Once alerted, a creature has several options:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle">
                    <li class="rd__li ">
                        <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Ambush"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Ambush.</span> The creature leaves its current location and takes up a position near the adventurers' location, hoping to catch the adventurers unaware. Ambushers try to hide and, once hidden, take advantage of any opportune moment to attack.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">
                        <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Fortify"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Fortify.</span> The creature attempts to fortify its location by using furniture or heavy objects to block doors or entryways. Increase the DC to force open a blocked door by 3, and hastily blocked passageways are @variantrule[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]. A creature with a ranged attack that selects this option seeks cover in its location.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">
                        <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Hide/Flee"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Hide/Flee.</span> If possible, the creature hides in its current location, hoping to avoid any adventurers that enter. If there is nowhere to hide, the creature flees to a location farther from the adventurers or flees to any nearby location occupied by its allies. If a fleeing creature reaches allies, those allies are immediately alerted to the presence of the adventurers; determine how those allies react.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">
                        <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Investigate"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Investigate.</span> The creature rushes to the sound of the disturbance to investigate, possibly joining any battle that is underway. A creature that passes near an ally while moving to investigate a disturbance might ask that ally to accompany it.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you can't decide what an alerted creature should do, have it make a [[/save ability=wis dc=10]] saving throw. On a successful save, the creature either investigates or lays an ambush; on a failed save, it hides or fortifies its location. When dealing with a group of creatures, the leader makes this saving throw on behalf of the entire group.</p>
                <p>As creatures employ reactive tactics, make notes about their new locations on your adventure map.</p>

                <p>Sapient creatures that have reason to believe their lair is likely to be invaded might set up a defense. Reasons to set up a defense include the following:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">Adventurers invaded the lair recently and retreated.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Scouts affiliated with the lair's denizens noticed the adventurers heading toward the lair.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">A spy in a nearby settlement overheard or discovered the adventurers' plans and alerted the lair's occupants.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Prepared defenders commonly use one or more of the following tactics:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle">
                    <li class="rd__li ">

If possible, these creatures might equip themselves with an alarm such as a horn or improvised gong (an empty kettle, perhaps). At the first sight of intruders, they raise the alarm, alerting nearby allies so those comrades can employ the reactive tactics described above.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">
                        <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Traps"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Traps.</span> The defenders might place additional traps, such as falling nets, throughout the lair (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#traps]{Traps}" in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 3}).</p>

        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Encounter Pace and Tension" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="484"><span class="entry-title-inner">Encounter Pace and Tension</span></h2>
            <p>A good story hooks you in with an interesting introduction, builds tension steadily throughout the story, then reaches a climactic conclusion. It's not always easy to mimic that structure in an adventure where the players control their characters' actions, but you can use the encounters you plan to build tension toward a climax.</p>
            <p>Each encounter in an adventure is an opportunity to make the characters' situation more complex and urgent, with more significant consequences. Successive encounters raise the tension in an adventure naturally, as characters spend their limited resources. Variety also contributes to a sense of escalating tension. Build variety into your encounters in three ways:</p>
            <ul class="rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle">
                <li class="rd__li ">
                    <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Vary Encounter Type"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Vary Encounter Type.</span> Use a mix of social interaction, exploration, and combat encounters. Different types of encounters provide different amounts of tension (generally, combat encounters offer the most), but they also feel very different and can have drastically different stakes.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="rd__li ">
                    <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Vary Encounter Difficulty"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Vary Encounter Difficulty.</span> Include encounters that offer low, moderate, and high difficulty. A mix of low- and moderate-difficulty encounters early in the adventure can lead to a climactic high-difficulty fight, perhaps against the adventure's primary villain or another threat.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="rd__li ">
                    <p class="rd__p-list-item" data-roll-name-ancestor="Vary Threats"><span class="bold rd__list-item-name">Vary Threats.</span> Build encounters using different threats. If the characters are delving into a kuo-toa temple and therefore expect many encounters to include various kuo-toa, look for opportunities to include different monsters that might serve as guards, pets, or allies to the kuo-toa. Include a variety of hazards, environmental dangers, and traps in exploration encounters, and use NPCs with different personalities and different goals in social interaction encounters.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Urgency and Rests" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="485"><span class="entry-title-inner">Urgency and Rests</span></h3>
                <p>While successive encounters increase tension, taking a Short Rest relaxes the tension somewhat, as characters have a chance to replenish some of their resources. In many adventures, though, the characters and their players have a sense that they need to act quickly to deal with the situation presented by the adventure. This creates tension between the need to rest and the sense that things are getting worse while the characters are resting.</p>
                <p>You can influence the pace and tension of your adventure by determining where and when the characters can rest. If the characters are exploring a vast dungeon, consider scattering a few small rooms with only one door, where the characters can bar the door and reasonably expect to spend an hour or even a night resting in safety. On the flip side, cautious characters might try to take a Short Rest between every encounter, never really straining their resources. It's OK to interrupt those rests once in a while to maintain a sense of tension or to heighten the urgency, making it clear that even an hour spent resting could jeopardize their chances of success.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Easing Up" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Easing Up.</span> It is possible to dial up the urgency to the point that the players feel they don't have time to investigate the interesting details they encounter in the world. When this happens, consider using a helpful NPC to take some of the pressure off. A wise elder might advise them that the situation is not as urgent as they fear, a whimsical Fey being might use magical mischief to force them to slow down, or a kindly Celestial could tell them they're taking the concerns of the mortal world just a bit too seriously.</p>

                <p>Random encounters are randomly determined encounters that don't occur in a fixed location. The options are often presented in a table. When a random encounter occurs, you roll a die and consult the table to determine what the party encounters. Sample random encounter tables appear in the adventure examples later in this chapter. Similar tables appear in many published adventures and rulebooks, and you can easily create your own by following these examples.</p>
                <p>Handled well, random encounters can serve a variety of useful purposes.</p>

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Reinforce Campaign Themes.</span> Random encounters can remind the players of the major themes and conflicts in your campaign. For example, if a war between two nations is a major conflict in your campaign, you might design random encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present threat of that conflict, including encounters with bedraggled troops returning from battle, refugees fleeing invaders, lone messengers riding for the front lines, enemy war parties, and so on.</p>

A random encounter with a wandering ogre might end with the ogre offering to help the characters get where they need to go, or the ogre might have something in a nearby den that is significant to the adventure story—a prisoner, a stolen item, or important information. Or the players might find the ogre's personality delightful, prompting you to make the ogre a more important part of the story.</p>

        <p>The climactic ending of an adventure fulfills the promise of all that came before. The best climax is one the players see coming, so if a dragon is the mastermind behind all the nefarious activity happening in an adventure, having the dragon's minions mention the nature of their boss sets up the coming climactic encounter.</p>

            <p>In most stories, there's a period after the climax, in which loose plot threads are tied up and everything is explained. An adventure might also include this kind of denouement: time to discover what treasure is in the dragon's hoard, an award ceremony where the queen gives medals to the victorious heroes, or even a time to mourn adventuring companions who didn't survive the battle.</p>
            <p>The denouement can also be an opportunity for the players to identify loose threads that haven't been tied up—threads that can lead them into the next adventure. The "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004#episodes-and-serials]{Episodes and Serials}" section in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000004]{chapter 5} offers suggestions for weaving these connecting threads.</p>

        <p>For some characters, the prospect of material reward is their primary reason for going on adventures. For others it's a welcome added benefit to pursuing their other goals.</p>
        <p>@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006]{Chapter 7} describes different kinds of treasure, but see also "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002#marks-of-prestige]{Marks of Prestige}" in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000002]{chapter 3} for other rewards you might use.</p>

            <p>Characters might find small amounts of treasure in the pockets, pouches, or personal stashes of individual monsters. Even if a monster doesn't intentionally collect treasure, characters might find scattered coins and other monetary treasure left behind by the monster's previous victims.</p>
            <p>You can use the Random Individual Treasure table to determine how much treasure a single monster has based on its Challenge Rating (CR). The table includes the average total in parentheses, which you can use instead of rolling. To determine the total amount of treasure for a group of similar creatures, you can roll once and multiply the total by the number of creatures in the group.</p>

            <p>Adventurers sometimes discover large caches of treasure, the accumulated wealth of a large group of creatures or the belongings of a single powerful creature that hoards valuables. The Random Treasure Hoard table can help you create such a cache. When determining the contents of a hoard belonging to one monster, use the row for that monster's Challenge Rating (CR). When the hoard belongs to a large group of monsters, use the CR of the monster that leads the group. Each row includes average results for monetary treasure, which you can use instead of rolling. To create a hoard for a monster that is particularly fond of amassing treasure (such as a dragon), you can roll twice on the table or roll once and double the total.</p>
            <p>As a rough benchmark, aim to roll on the Random Treasure Hoard table about once per game session. Use the guidelines in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006]{chapter 7} to determine which magic items are in the hoard (see "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#awarding-magic-items]{Awarding Magic Items}" and "@UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000006#random-magic-item-rarity]{Random Magic Items}").</p>

Melchis immediately attempts to seize the Artifact and place it on his head. If he does, he is transformed into a @creature[Hezrou|XMM] and tries to kill the characters.

The Artifact can't be removed from the character's head until a @spell[Remove Curse|XPHB] spell is cast on the character. If the characters defeat Melchis and search him, they find a @item[Bag of Holding|XDMG] containing twelve 5-pound gold trade bars (worth 250 GP each) and a @item[Spell Scroll|XDMG] of @spell[Teleportation Circle|XPHB]. The scroll also contains the sigil sequence for a permanent teleportation circle. At the end of the adventure, each character earns a bonus 1,000 XP.</p>

                <p>The adventure plays out over three dances. During each one, the characters can decide whether they dance, mingle, watch the dancers, or engage in some other activity. (The Manor map in @UUID[JournalEntry.3KMrhkNGZEvncu7o.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000009#manor]{Appendix B} can serve as a floor plan for the baron's palace.)

These guests pay particular attention to the characters:</p>

Once used, the Charm vanishes. Each character also earns a bonus 1,700 XP.</p>
