    </h1>
    <p>Visitantes da cidade duergar de Gracklstugh são recebidos por seu ar quente e acre, seguido pelo brilho vermelho
        e irritado das fornalhas eternamente acesas alimentando as metalúrgicas da cidade, seu coração retumbante, e as
        forjas mantidas vivas pelas chamas de @creature[Themberchaud|OotA], o dragão vermelho que detém o título de
        Wyrmsmith. Gracklstugh trabalha incansavelmente, seus ferreiros produzindo as melhores armaduras e armas entre
        as raças do Underdark. Aqueles que fazem negócios aqui referem-se a Gracklstugh como "a Cidade das Lâminas".</p>
    <p>Por mais impiedosa que possa ser, Gracklstugh é um grande bastião da civilização no Underdark com rotas de
        comércio ativas. Para os personagens, isso significa uma chance potencial de encontrar um caminho de volta para
        o mundo da superfície&mdash;e, tão importante quanto, despistar os drow que os perseguem. No entanto, os
        aventureiros rapidamente perceberão que o poder dos senhores demônios é uma ameaça até mesmo aqui, tendo uma
        visão ainda mais próxima da decadência do Underdark à medida que a loucura do Abismo continua a se espalhar.</p>
    <p>Construída nas paredes de uma caverna profunda ao sudoeste do Darklake, Gracklstugh é o centro comercial,
        político e espiritual dos duergar, todos os quais olham para o Deepking com respeito. A cidade tem uma costa
        aberta ao longo do Darklake, enquanto várias cavernas e passagens conectam Gracklstugh a outras partes do
        Underdark para facilitar viagens e comércio.</p>
    <p>Os personagens têm a chance de testemunhar e moldar eventos na cidade que apontam para o perigo que Gracklstugh
        enfrenta&mdash;e quão despreparada a cidade está para isso. Mas a cada momento que os personagens passam na
        Cidade das Lâminas, correm o risco de ter escapado dos drow apenas para serem escravizados pelos duergar.</p>

        <p>Apesar de seus perigos, Gracklstugh tem algumas coisas a oferecer... ou pelo menos é o que alguns dos
            companheiros dos personagens dizem a eles.</p>
        <p>@creature[Buppido|OotA] (veja o capítulo 1) e Hemeth (veja o capítulo 3) são os únicos NPCs que sugerem
            ativamente ir para Gracklstugh. Eles sabem que os duergar não têm amor pelos drow, e suas leis draconianas
            mantêm todos os estrangeiros sob controle, o que deve fornecer um certo grau de santuário da perseguição
            drow. Gracklstugh é tão bom lugar quanto qualquer outro no Underdark para vender equipamentos roubados e
            comprar equipamentos mais úteis. Além disso, os duergar negociam ativamente com outras raças subterrâneas e
            da superfície. O Blade Bazaar de Gracklstugh pode ser o lugar ideal para encontrar comerciantes ou
            exploradores indo para o mundo da superfície.</p>
        <p>Se @creature[Buppido|OotA] ou Hemeth não estiverem com o grupo, outros podem fornecer as informações acima.
            Sarith resiste a planos de viajar para a cidade no início, consciente do pouco respeito que os duergar têm
            pelos drow. Ele muda de ideia rapidamente, no entanto, quando os esporos de Zuggtmoy o levam a buscar uma
            área densamente povoada onde ele pode espalhar sua contaminação.</p>
        <p>Também é possível que o grupo chegue a Gracklstugh involuntariamente. Escravizadores duergar vasculham o
            Underdark em busca de novo "mercadoria", e eles podem enganar ou simplesmente capturar os personagens e
            levá-los para os mercados de escravos de sua cidade. Os encontros aleatórios nos capítulos 2 e 3 podem
            facilmente configurar esse cenário.</p>

                    Perseguição Drow</span></h2>
            <p>Buscar refúgio em Gracklstugh tem suas vantagens. Cada dia que passam na capital duergar, os personagens
                podem tentar um teste de grupo de Destreza (@skill[Stealth]) com CD 16 para se movimentar com cautela,
                com sucesso indicando que evitam chamar a atenção para si mesmos. Os personagens também podem tentar um
                teste de grupo de Sabedoria (@skill[Insight]) com CD 13 para avaliar o clima na cidade, com sucesso
                permitindo que evitem problemas antes que comece. Personagens que se mantêm discretos durante o dia têm
                vantagem neste teste de Sabedoria.</p>
            <p>O sucesso em qualquer um dos testes reduz o nível de perseguição do grupo em 1 (veja "Perseguição Drow"
                no capítulo 2).</p>

                    Gracklstugh</span></h2>
            <p>O Distrito Darklake é um ponto de entrada provável para a cidade para os personagens, seja chegando pela
                água ou viajando por um dos muitos túneis que levam aos portões do distrito. Não-duergar chegando de
                túneis que levam a outros distritos são parados e escoltados até o Distrito Darklake sob forte guarda,
                já que todos os outros distritos são normalmente proibidos para estrangeiros, e invasores correm o risco
                de serem confrontados por uma patrulha @condition[invisible] de quatro duergar.</p>
            <p>Os companheiros de fuga do grupo sabem que tentar entrar pelas entradas principais é uma maneira certa de
                serem escravizados, a menos que um dos personagens seja um mentiroso épico que possa convencer os
                guardas de que o grupo é uma delegação diplomática ou comercial legítima. Qualquer um com um histórico
                de comerciante ou criminoso ouviu rumores de que os Zhentarim negociam no Underdark, mas se passar por
                Zhentarim tem seus próprios riscos, já que tais afirmações certamente serão questionadas. Um personagem
                que é realmente um membro dos Zhentarim pode comprar aos aventureiros alguns dias dentro da cidade antes
                que os escravizadores duergar comecem a medir seus valores.</p>
            <p>Chegar pelo Darklake Docks é mais fácil e discreto. Se os personagens estiverem viajando de barco,
                @creature[Buppido|OotA] pode guiá-los a um píer deserto onde podem atracar silenciosamente. Ele os
                adverte que precisam manter um perfil baixo e seguir diretamente para a única estalagem da cidade
                dedicada a estrangeiros. A Pousada Ghohlbrorn's Lair é frequentada por comerciantes, mercenários e
                outros estrangeiros que podem oferecer informações sobre viagens para outros lugares do
                Underdark&mdash;ou talvez até para o mundo da superfície.</p>

                    acenam para os personagens antes de reprimir o resto da multidão. Rapidamente se espalha a palavra

                    aos personagens vantagem em testes feitos para interagir com qualquer duergar na cidade até que tal

                        simples, mas rigoroso, de lei, honra, trabalho árduo e veem todos os não-duergar como criaturas
                        inferiores. Duergar são impiedosos, mas não cruelmente desnecessários, e o pragmatismo direciona
                        todas as suas decisões. Embora tratem os aventureiros com desprezo, seu primeiro pensamento é
                        escravizá-los ou usá-los em vez de matá-los.</p>
                    <p>Os duergar de Gracklstugh estão começando a sofrer os efeitos da chegada dos senhores
                        demônios&mdash;e especificamente a influência de Demogorgon. Muitos estão desenvolvendo tiques,
                        hábitos e comportamentos que vão contra suas crenças centrais, incluindo guardas exibindo seu
                        comportamento corrupto, o uso de adornos por si só, e deslealdade a seus clãs. Recentemente, o
                        povo de Gracklstugh tornou-se cada vez mais violento, abandonando sua astúcia característica e
                        pragmatismo estoico por malícia gratuita e exibições mesquinhas de auto-entendimento.</p>
                    <p>Ao contrário dos duergar disciplinados, os derro são desleixados, erráticos e completamente
                        insanos. Seu temperamento é volúvel e seu discurso difícil de seguir. A única emoção garantida
                        que eles têm ao interagir com outros é um ódio fervente, e eles não fazem esforço para
                        escondê-lo. Seus olhos são traiçoeiros, seus dentes rangem e parecem que preferiam estar em
                        outro lugar. Eles odeiam todos e tudo, mas os habitantes da superfície são alvos particulares de
                        seu desprezo.</p>
                    <p>Sua insanidade inerente significa que os derro não sofrem nenhum efeito negativo da presença dos
                        senhores demônios, suas mentes já são muito voláteis e mercuriais.</p>

                ofício. Uma casta de sacerdotes chamada <em>thuldar</em> oficializa todos os rituais e registra a

                    distribui favores inesperadamente e deixa claro que usará qualquer artimanha para manter seu poder.

                            é secundário à função estrutural de um edifício. As únicas ornamentações encontradas em
                            Gracklstugh são representações icônicas de rank e função dentro da sociedade duergar, e a
                            única música é o martelar rítmico incessante nas forjas. Os duergar consideram a arte uma

                        <p>The constant smog in Gracklstugh causes grackle-lung in living, breathing creatures,
                            resulting in persistent, wracking coughs and the spewing of thick, black phlegm. Whenever a
                            living, breathing creature finishes a long rest in Gracklstugh, it must make a DC 11
                            Constitution saving throw. On each failed save, the creature gains one level of
                            @condition[exhaustion] as its airways become increasingly clogged. A creature that reaches
                            level 6 @condition[exhaustion] dies, as normal.</p>
                        <p>A creature with one or more levels of @condition[exhaustion] brought on by grackle-lung must
                            succeed on a Constitution check to take the @action[Dash] action. If the check fails, the
                            action cannot be attempted. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a verbal
                            component, it must succeed on a Constitution check or be unable to complete the spell,
                            causing the spell to fail with no effect. The DC for each check is 10 + the creature's
                            current @condition[exhaustion] level.</p>
                        <p>If a creature's @condition[exhaustion] level drops below 1, it no longer suffers the effects
                            of grackle-lung and becomes immune to it for the next week. Duergar and derro are inured to
                            grackle-lung, making Constitution checks against it with advantage. Any spell or effect that
                            cures disease also cures grackle-lung, effectively removing all levels of
                            @condition[exhaustion] brought on by the affliction.</p>

                    reclusive and averse to conflict, the giants have sworn an ancient oath of loyalty to the Deepking,
                    and have been serving his line for as long as any can remember. This oath, however, was given only
                    to the Steelshadow clan. If the throne passes to another dynasty, the stone giants will cease to be
                    the city's allies.</p>

                    Underdark, but isn't aware of the threat's danger or extent. The giants will rise to defend
                    Gracklstugh if any demons dare to invade, but they are unaware of the danger creeping into the city

            <p>The duergar are called gray dwarves not only because of the color of their skin, but also because of
                their drab and joyless lifestyle. While they make no time for merriment, the duergar have a culture as
                rich and complex as any other, and nowhere is this so evident as in Gracklstugh.</p>
            <p>Work never stops in the City of Blades, and the gray dwarves take pride in efficiency and perfection even
                as they abhor waste and carelessness. They are merciless masters to the derro and slaves who toil and

                <p>By appearance and bearing, all duergar know their place and where they belong. Whether as
                    individuals, families, or entire clans, duergar below other duergar in the social order don't seek
                    to bring their rivals down through intrigue and deceit. Rather, they roll up their sleeves and work

                <p>All the honor and honesty the duergar apply among themselves doesn't apply to outsiders. The gray
                    dwarves constantly try to manipulate contracts to take advantage of foreign merchants, looking for
                    any excuse to enslave random visitors who appear weak or vulnerable&mdash;including adventurers.</p>
                <p>Though they aren't moved by vanity, duergar are extremely proud of their work, and praising the
                    quality of duergar crafting can sometimes help outsiders in their dealings with the gray dwarves.

                <p>The bottom rung in Gracklstugh society is mostly occupied by the underclass of the derro. Enslaved by
                    the duergar centuries ago, then freed, the derro aren't allowed to hold honest jobs, and their
                    rights are hardly ever recognized by the duergar. Even slaves are held in higher regard. Derro
                    scuttle about like vermin and are mostly confined to hovels built along the walls of Laduguer's

                    existence apart from family and clan. Those who live on become bitter and tough, with many leaving
                    Gracklstugh as hermits or adventurers, or turning to crime and a life in the shadows. Members of
                    both the Gray Ghosts and the Empty-Scabbard Killers include a significant number of calassabrak, no

                        the dual aspect of Demogorgon. The derro cultists plan to offer the entire city to their newly

                    brought before the Council of Lairds, which resolves matters swiftly and harshly. The code of
                    punishment is simple. Because dishonor, mutilation and imprisonment are a waste of resources and
                    create weakness in society, a duergar who intentionally commits any crime receives a death sentence.
                    Accidental crime by a duergar is compensated by goods or work equivalent to the damages. Derro,
                    slaves or outsiders caught committing any crime can be executed on the spot by any duergar present.

    <p>The cavern housing Gracklstugh is split in two by a rift called Laduguer's Furrow, after the duergar patron god.
        The north half comprises Northfurrow District, where common workers and the clans devoted to minor crafts make
        their home, and Darklake District, open to foreigners and where the city's merchants engage in trade with
        visitors. As befits a major settlement in a dangerous realm, Gracklstugh places no restrictions on the weapons
        or gear characters can carry or trade.</p>
    <p>Twelve stone bridges lead to Southfurrow District, and then farther south to Flowstone District. These boroughs
        are reserved for the more prestigious clans and the largest smelters and forges @creature[Themberchaud|OotA]
        ignites during his flights. The Wyrmsmith's lair and the cavern complex the stone giants of Cairngorm Clan call
        home both connect to these districts.</p>

        <p>Entering the city is the first major hurdle the characters must surmount in Gracklstugh. Unless they heed
            @creature[Buppido|OotA]'s advice to arrive by way of the Darklake (or come up with the idea on their own),
            the characters reach one of the gates. (See "Arriving in Gracklstugh" earlier in this chapter.)</p>

            <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="356"><span class="entry-title-inner">City Gates</span></h3>
            <p>The pragmatic nature of the duergar means that all Gracklstugh's entrance gates are similar in design,
                for ease of maintenance and the training of guards.</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud "><span

                <p>The ground at your feet has been getting smoother and flatter, a welcome respite from the uneven
                    passages to which you have grown wearily accustomed. Eventually, stone tiles become more noticeable,
                    turning the path into a proper road. You can see spots of light in the distance, blue-white and too
                    regularly placed to be phosphorescent mushrooms.</p>
                <p>The lights are proper lamps flanking two massive stone gates blocking the tunnel. Before you get a
                    chance to examine the intricate carvings on the gates' surface, a harsh voice hisses from a slit on
                    the cavern wall that was not therebefore.</p>
                <p>"State your names and business!" the voice orders in Dwarvish. Other similar slits open, revealing
                    the tips of a dozen crossbow bolts. Behind you, a metallic din announces a group of six heavily
                    armored dwarves appearing out of thin air, their swords leveled at you from behind sturdy metal
                    shields.</p>
                <div class="float-clear">&nbsp;</div>
            </div>
            <p>When the characters first reached the road, six @creature[duergar] watching invisibly started following
                them at a safe distance. Twelve more @creature[duergar] soldiers are stationed in guardhouses concealed
                within the rocky walls of the cavern, all of them aiming heavy crossbows at the party.</p>
            <p>The duergar are hostile, and the guard who spoke follows up on every answer the characters give. One
                character can take the lead in the interrogation by speaking for the party and making a DC 15 Charisma
                check (@skill[Deception] and @skill[Persuasion] apply; @skill[Intimidation] or @skill[Performance] are
                met with scorn). Depending on how believable the party's story is and how the other adventurers behave
                during the questioning, you might allow the character to make the check with advantage or impose
                disadvantage.</p>
            <p>The guard grudgingly lets the characters pass if the check succeeds, and refuses them entrance if it
                fails. If the check fails by 5 or more, the guard gives the order to arrest the characters, announcing
                that they are now slaves of the duergar (see "Getting Captured" below).</p>
            <p>The first time the characters are allowed inside the city or turned away from a gate, a secret door on
                the wall opens, revealing Gorglak, a @creature[duergar Stone Guard|MTF] (see <a
                    href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#OotA,19">appendix C</a>).</p>

                <p>"Well." The duergar removes his helmet, revealing the gray skin of his kind. He musses his white
                    beard as he walks closer, switching to Common as he lowers his voice. There is a discomfiting glint
                    in his eyes and his smile. "You are clearly lying. I ought to just send you to the slave pens,
                    but... you amuse me. What do you have that is worth your freedom?"</p>
                <p>The duergar waits for your answer, his gaze touching on each of you in turn as he smiles in
                    anticipation.</p>
                <div class="float-clear">&nbsp;</div>
            </div>
            <p>If they are with the party, @creature[Topsy|OotA] and @creature[Turvy|OotA], @creature[Sarith
                Kzekarit|OotA], @creature[Jimjar|OotA], and @creature[Buppido|OotA] can whisper to the characters that
                few duergar are so blatantly corrupt as Gorglak seems to be. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (@skill[Insight])
                check lets a character notice that Gorglak is eying the adventurers' weapons (especially any drow
                weapons or magic weapons they might have), and that there's something odd about his behavior. The
                madness creeping into Gracklstugh has made Gorglak obsessed with rare weapons. He's willing to go to
                great extents to acquire new weapons of exquisite design for his growing collection.</p>
            <p>Offering Gorglak a worthy weapon for his collection gets the characters through the gate. Any other bribe
                requires one of the characters to succeed on a DC 13 Charisma (@skill[Persuasion]) check, or Gorglak is
                insulted and has the party arrested. If the characters are too open about the negotiation, Gorglak has
                them arrested and pretends he didn't say anything.</p>
            <p>If Gorglak finds the characters' bribe appealing, he refuses to accept it then and there, instead
                directing them to find one Werz Saltbaron in the Darklake Docks and hand the bribe to him. Gorglak tells
                the characters that he will check with Werz at the end of his shift, and will find the characters and
                arrest them if they have not paid by then.</p>
            <p>Characters allowed through the gate are escorted to the Darklake District by four @creature[duergar]
                guards, two of whom are @condition[invisible]. Once the party reaches the edge of the district, the
                guards leave and return to the posts.</p>

            <p>Arriving at the Darklake Docks requires a combination of skill, ingenuity, and luck. Vigilance is a
                little more relaxed here because the guards at Overlake Hold can spot any obvious threat coming from the

                    Underdark is becoming warmer even at this distance, and you can now see a variety of piers made from
                    zurkhwood, stone, and plain rock jutting out along the edge of a huge cavern.</p>

                cavern. Otherwise, the characters must make a successful DC 14 group Dexterity (@skill[Stealth]) check
                or a DC 15 group Wisdom (@skill[Survival]) check to guide their boat safely and inconspicuously to an
                empty dock. If the group check fails, nearby guards notice the characters but don't immediately identify
                them as a threat. However, you can choose to impose disadvantage on any checks the characters make to
                remain inconspicuous during their first day in Gracklstugh.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>Even after making it inside the city, the characters must tread carefully, as the duergar use the
                slightest pretext to arrest them. Even trying to haggle with a duergar merchant might inspire a call for
                the guards to take the characters away. Getting caught stealing is punishable by death on the spot, but
                guards or the offended party might see some value in enslaving the culprits instead, so the characters
                can be shackled and shipped beyond the Darklake District. Resisting arrest is a truly bad idea; every
                duergar around is reinforcement.</p>
            <p>If the characters get arrested, you can interrupt their transfer with a random encounter or lead them to
                other planned encounters. The "Rampaging Giant" encounter (which takes place in the Darklake District)
                is the most likely event to interrupt a prisoner transfer. Alternatively, an agent of the Keepers of the
                Flame can stop the guards before they take the characters to Overlake Hold (see
                "@creature[Themberchaud|OotA]'s Lair" for information regarding the keepers' interest in foreign
                mercenaries).</p>
            <p>Possible offers of employment in the Blade Bazaar can also be turned into timely rescues for the
                adventurers. Otherwise, they end up in Overlake Hold, interrogated by Errde Blackskull.</p>

        <p>The Darklake District gives an illusion of openness. The streets are relatively wide to allow for merchant
            carts and wagons to pass, and the buildings aren't as crowded around stalagmites as in the southern
            districts. Openness doesn't mean welcoming, however. The duergar who ply their trades here are wary of all
            the foreigners confined by law to this part of the city.</p>

                across the city within hollowed-out columns and stalagmites.</p>
            <p>Though the streets are crowded, you move easily within the surging throng of buyers, merchants, and
                slaves. You aren't the only outsiders here, as you spy drow, svirfneblin, derro, orcs, and other races
                in the crowds. The shouting of people blends with the sound of distant hammering to create a constant,

        <p>Behind the forbidding walls separating the Darklake District from the rest of the city stand the docks,
            markets, and shops where Gracklstugh's commerce and trade are conducted. The many duergar
            merchants&mdash;along with drow, svirfneblin, orcs, and others&mdash;pay little attention to the characters
            unless they are looking to do business.</p>
        <p>Guards posted at the gates make it clear to the characters that non-duergar are restricted to the Darklake
            District, and the characters have better luck asking other outsiders for directions rather than trying to
            engage the duergar locals. They are directed to the Blade Bazaar if they wish to sell anything they might be
            carrying with them. For gossip and a meal, the Shattered Spire tavern is recommended, while lodging for

                <p>The rhythmic hammering of the city's forges is drowned for a second by a thundering roar and the
                    sound of crumbling rock. Duergar and visitors alike turn to look as a two-headed, gray-skinned giant
                    bursts through a gate, howling madly and lashing out left and right, littering the plaza with rock
                    and stone debris. As he bellows, one of his swings connects with a duergar soldier, whose broken
                    body flies through the air and crashes near you with a sickening crunch.</p>

            <p>A @creature[stone giant] from Cairngorm Cavern has succumbed to a demonic curse that has caused him to
                grow a disfigured second head. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (@skill[Insight]) check reveals that the giant
                is crazed and terrified. Use the stone giant stat block with the following modifications:</p>
            <ul class="rd__list">
                <li class="rd__li ">The giant has advantage on Wisdom (@skill[Perception]) checks and on saving throws
                    against being @condition[blinded], @condition[charmed], @condition[deafened],
                    @condition[frightened], @condition[stunned], or knocked @condition[unconscious].</li>
                <li class="rd__li ">The giant is unarmed. As an action, it can make two unarmed strikes (+9 to hit,
                    reach 10 ft., one target). On a hit, the giant deals 13 ([[/r 2d6 + 6]]) bludgeoning damage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The rampage happens in a broad plaza, so there is plenty of space for the different combatants to
                maneuver.</p>
            <p>The giant moves in the characters' direction and lashes out. Two @creature[duergar] guards and two
                @creature[duergar xarrorn|MTF] (see <a
                    href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#OotA,19">appendix C</a>) respond to the
                giant's roaring, racing in to join the fight in the second round. They are well trained and do their
                best to help, but to avoid additional complexity during the encounter, assume that the duergar act at
                the end of the initiative order and deal a flat total of 10 damage to the giant each round.</p>
            <p>Bystanders take cover at once, but @creature[duergar] citizens are ready to jump in if the guards fail to
                contain the threat. The giant ignores characters attacking from range and attacks opponents in melee at
                random, including the duergar. Both the giant and the guards fight until they drop to 0 hit points.</p>
            <div class="rd__b  rd__b--2">

                </h3>
                <p>Without the characters' help, the guards and assisting citizens bring down the stone giant with few
                    casualties. If the characters are prisoners under escort when the giant attacks, the guards who
                    engage the giant are their escort. The characters can use this chance to escape, or they can help,
                    albeit with disadvantage on attack rolls if they are shackled. The duergar are pragmatists and
                    release characters who help them deal with the giant's threat, but they attempt to arrest them again
                    after the combat is over.</p>
                <p>Once the crazed giant is put down, another stone giant comes through the shattered gate, but this one
                    looks perfectly sane. He reaches the fallen giant at the same time as a squad of three
                    @creature[Duergar Stone Guard|MTF|duergar stone guards] (see <a
                        href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#OotA,19">appendix C</a>).</p>
                <p>The guards who fought alongside the characters explain the situation, neither downplaying nor
                    exalting the characters' actions. The characters can speak to the newly arrived giant while the
                    duergar confer. The giant introduces himself as Dorhun, apprentice to Stonespeaker Hgraam. He
                    reveals that the fallen giant's name is Rihuud, and that he was another of the Stonespeaker's
                    apprentices. Rihuud was "communing with the stone" in Cairngorm Cavern when he went mad, sprouted a
                    second head, and stormed out.</p>
                <p>If the party was not previously arrested and didn't participate in the fight, the Stone Guards start
                    questioning bystanders, who eventually point out the characters as new arrivals to the city.</p>
                <p>If the characters knocked Rihuud @condition[unconscious] instead of dealing a lethal blow, a grateful
                    Dorhun asks them to visit Cairngorm Cavern before they leave the city, informing the Stone Guards of
                    this. The importance of the Stonespeaker means that the Stone Guards will escort the party across
                    the city to meet with him, though they don't hide their displeasure at doing so.</p>

                    rings worth 25 gp each, and two gem-inlaid necklaces worth 250 gp each. She has tracked the pieces

                    rags styled as an imitation of a fancy jacket, wearing a wide-brimmed hat with two tentacles from a
                    displacer beast sewn into the hat's crown. A large satchel hangs from his shoulder, and he's always
                    muttering to himself.</p>

                        Pursuit</span></h3>
                <p>If the characters arrive in Gracklstugh with a drow pursuit level of 3 or higher (see "Drow Pursuit"
                    in chapter 2), Ilvara has already sent a party ahead of them, guessing correctly that the escaped
                    prisoners might seek refuge with the duergar.</p>
                <p>Characters with a passive Wisdom (@skill[Perception]) score of 15 or higher spot six @creature[drow]
                    watching them in the Blade Bazaar. One of them is Xalith Masq'il'yr, a female drow allied with House
                    Mizzrym. Any of the party's NPC companions who know the duergar well can guess that these drow won't
                    want to attract the duergar's attention to their "lost property." Doing so would likely involve
                    having to pay the gray dwarves a reward for the adventurers' capture. This gives the characters a
                    chance to evade their pursuers, but they need to stay out of sight.</p>
                <p>Xalith speaks to the duergar only if the characters are arrested. Otherwise, she sends a messenger to
                    Ilvara and makes sure the characters don't go anywhere without her knowing. If the characters fail
                    to lose themselves in the city (see "Gracklstugh and Drow Pursuit" earlier in this chapter), their
                    pursuit level increases by 1 every [[/r 1d4]] days until Ilvara arrives.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, the adventurers might decide to turn the tables on the drow. Characters might figure
                    out a way to quietly neutralize Xalith and her squad, perhaps tricking them into damaging a duergar
                    merchant's property or forcing them outside Darklake District, where even drow are forbidden to go.
                    Doing so decreases the pursuit level by 2. However, if combat ever breaks out between the characters
                    and the drow, a squad of five @creature[Duergar Stone Guard|MTF|duergar stone guards] (see <a
                        href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#OotA,19">appendix C</a>) and five
                    @creature[duergar] warriors arrive within [[/r 1d4]] rounds and arrest the lot of them (see "Getting
                    Captured").</p>

                filling the air with a heavy, yeasty stink. Dozens of copper kegs stand nearby, and burly gray dwarves
                swarm over the place, mashing fungus, mixing fermenting masses, and filling casks with freshly brewed
                ale. This complex is the workplace and home of Clan Muzgardt, the duergar clan in charge of brewing
                Darklake Stout and in control of the brewing and importation of other spirits. Non-duergar aren't

                    duergar appear next to him and stab him viciously with glowing swords. The assassins' faces are
                    masked and hooded. The characters have 2 rounds to distract the two @creature[Duergar
                    Soulblade|MTF|duergar soulblades] (see <a

                <p>The merchant is Werz Saltbaron. If the characters save him, he is grudgingly grateful and says he has
                    no idea why the assassins targeted him. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (@skill[Insight]) check suggests
                    he's lying. He flees the scene, but not before telling the characters to meet him at the Shattered
                    Spire the following day so he can reward them properly.</p>
                <p>The characters have 1 minute to search the assassins before a patrol of four @creature[duergar]
                    arrives. The glowing weapons wielded by the assassins are nowhere to be found, but one of the
                    assassins has a piece of fish-skin parchment bearing Werz's likeness drawn in charcoal.</p>

                    <p>Errde explains that her guards have been tracking the movements of a derro named
                        @creature[Droki|OotA]. Despite his presence in the Darklake District, the derro has managed to
                        avoid capture, as if he somehow knows in advance where the duergar patrols will
                        be&mdash;@condition[invisible] or otherwise. All the Stone Guards know is that
                        @creature[Droki|OotA] lives in the West Cleft District, a place the duergar enter only in force
                        and where their presence would likely provoke a chaotic uprising. Errde wants the characters to
                        follow @creature[Droki|OotA], see what he does and where he goes, and report back. Or if they
                        see an opportunity, seize him and either bring him in for questioning, or kill him and bring
                        back evidence of his activities.</p>

                    <p>Errde's tone turns dark as she voices her suspicions that @creature[Droki|OotA] is linked to a
                        conspiracy involving the Council of Savants, and maybe even elements among the clan lairds. She
                        describes in detail how discovering the conspiracy and purging the corrupt will earn her great
                        favor with the Deepking. Errde swears (truthfully) that she will arrange for the characters to
                        get safe passage out of Gracklstugh if they do as she asks.</p>

                    <p>Errde's suspicions of conspiracy have her looking for signs of corruption creeping among the
                        people of Gracklstugh. She rewards the characters if they bring her evidence of such corruption
                        that has escaped the eyes of her warriors. The characters can build a case if they witness odd
                        events throughout Gracklstugh, such as some of the random encounters and the behavior of
                        merchants in the Blade Bazaar. For every three such events they report, the characters can
                        attempt a DC 15 group Charisma (@skill[Persuasion]) check, but they only need to succeed once to
                        convince Errde and complete this quest. Errde then promises to outfit the characters with
                        supplies and gear when they leave Gracklstugh, from the Stone Guards' own armory. Each character
                        can claim a total of 350 gp worth of equipment, including weapons, armor, and common potions and
                        scrolls.</p>

                <p>If the characters refuse Errde's offer after being arrested, they spend a few days imprisoned and
                    then are sold back to the drow. Xalith and her squad meet up with Ilvara and then return to
                    Velkynvelve, if the characters can't manage to escape from their captors.</p>
                <p>If the characters accept Errde's offer, she gives them insignias allowing them to move as far south
                    as Laduguer's Furrow without being accosted by guards. The adventurers need only to show the
                    insignias discreetly when confronted, and should keep them hidden otherwise. They are then released
                    without fanfare. Errde knows about the stone giants' invitation if the characters spared the
                    two-headed giant's life, and advises the characters to heed it before looking for
                    @creature[Droki|OotA].</p>
                <p>The characters' pursuit level is reduced to 0 and remains so while they are in Errde's employ inside
                    Gracklstugh. If they end their employment, the Stone Guards stop covering for them and their pursuit
                    level increases as normal if Xalith is in town (see "Signs of Pursuit" in the "Blade Bazaar"
                    section). Otherwise, it remains at 0 until some other action raises it again.</p>

                    dangerous recently. The fauna and more primitive denizens of the Underdark are all riled up about
                    something. Among the tales told by the travelers, second-hand stories about demons attacking
                    isolated settlements are common.</p>

        <p>Long ago, an earthquake split the cavern that houses Gracklstugh, leaving a rift nearly two hundred feet deep
            and five hundred feet wide. Laduguer's Furrow has a packed-gravel floor and extends roughly a quarter mile
            beyond the natural walls of the city in both directions. Each end of the rift has a steeply sloping floor,
            carved with a set of stairs and a wide ramp for both pedestrians and wagons. Vents along the walls release
            potent gases that sappers of Clan Xardelvar tap for industrial applications, including the crafting of the
            magical flame lances used by xarrorn warriors.</p>
        <p>The chasm is Gracklstugh's main residential zone, with homes built on the top part of its north and south
            sides. Outsiders are normally forbidden from this area.</p>

            <p>Near the western gate of Laduguer's Furrow, the duergar built a series of guardhouses to keep an eye on
                derro slaves living in the West Cleft. These were abandoned when Deepking Tarngardt, grandfather of the
                current monarch, liberated the derro, allowing them to spread from the West Cleft District into the East
                Cleft District. The guardhouses now stand empty, providing an ideal place to lie low and keep an eye on

            and dangerous ghetto. The East Cleft District was more recently settled after the derro earned their
            freedom, though it is only slightly less rough than West Cleft.</p>
        <p>The homes of the derro are mostly burrows carved into the walls and simple structures piled atop one another.
            The dirty and cluttered streets of both districts formed as dwellings spread and came together, and not as a
            product of planning. The derro population is much greater and their tunnels extend much farther than the
            duergar believe. The derro are close to mounting an insurrection, held back only by their own lack of
            organization and by their leaders in the Council of Savants having grown too used to their privileges to

                    crudely carved from the rock or are just holes in the walls, arranged in no apparent order. The
                    chatter in the air is unnerving, with hundreds of derro muttering, screaming at each other, and

                hour.</p>
            <p>Sneaking through the senseless arrangement of the burrows is relatively easy, as the derro are normally
                too preoccupied with their own mad scheming to notice a group trying not to attract attention. The
                characters can attempt a DC 10 group Dexterity (@skill[Stealth]) check, with success negating the need
                to roll for a possible attack at the end of each hour or half hour.</p>
            <p>Other means of subterfuge such as illusions, climbing along the walls, or using flying or levitation
                magic automatically avoid detection, but invisibility of any kind activates magical wards placed by

                an @condition[invisible] creature, nearby derro fly into a frenzy, creating a chaotic mob meant to drive
                away @condition[invisible] duergar patrols. Derro make active Wisdom (@skill[Perception]) checks
                contested by the characters' Dexterity (@skill[Stealth]) checks if a ward is activated. Characters using
                @spell[detect magic] actively can spot the @condition[invisible] sensor of a ward before it activates.
                Otherwise, @condition[invisible] characters encounter a ward every 15 minutes they move through derro

                    the Whorlstone Tunnels' entrance.</p>
                <p>Any attempt to question the locals without an effective means of disguise or manipulation, such as
                    enchantment or illusion magic, is doomed to fail, as the derro are more likely to attack the
                    characters than answer their questions. Even then, the derro are often incoherent, and a successful
                    DC 15 Charisma (@skill[Persuasion]) check is needed to obtain useful information. A successful DC 15
                    Charisma (@skill[Intimidation]) check also works, but has a 50 percent chance of inspiring the derro

            <p>If the adventurers helped stop the rampaging giant in the Darklake District (and especially if they
                didn't kill him), Hgraam is expecting them by the entrance to the Cairngorm Caverns. Though the stone

                questions, including ways to return to the "dreamlands," as the stone giants call the surface world.
                Because he has never left the Underdark, the paths he knows have come to him only as whispers through
                the stone. As such, you can easily shape his advice to your players' plans.</p>

        <p>For some time now, the Keepers have been actively seeking capable mercenaries in Gracklstugh and taking any
            opportunity to press them into service. If an agent of the order intervened in the characters' arrest (see

            magical messaging. He waits for the characters as they are brought to the dragon's cavern&mdash;but
            @creature[Adult Red Dragon||Themberchaud] is watching too.</p>

                events that led them to Gracklstugh.</p>
            <p>@creature[Themberchaud|OotA] makes the characters an offer: become his agents in Gracklstugh, and gain

                        Keepers</span></h3>
                <p>When the characters are done with @creature[Themberchaud|OotA], they exit the lair to where Gartokkar
                    waits to take them to the guard house where the Keepers of the Flame keep watch. He darkly asks what
                    business the dragon had with them, but what the characters choose to tell him (and whether they
                    intend to follow up on the dragon's orders) is up to them.</p>
                <p>The power of the Keepers of the Flame derives in equal measure from their psionic abilities, the
                    leadership of the Deepking, and their influence over @creature[Themberchaud|OotA]. They lost face
                    when the Gray Ghosts stole the valuable red dragon egg that would hatch
                    @creature[Themberchaud|OotA]'s replacement, and they have been waging war on the thieves' guild ever
                    since. But with the egg still lost and their control over @creature[Themberchaud|OotA] waning, the
                    Keepers are exploring all options in their war against the Gray Ghosts.</p>
                <p>The psionic Keepers have sensed a great disturbance in the Underdark&mdash;a phenomenon that
                    Gartokkar compares to a hole having been torn through the world. The Keepers have no idea about the
                    demonic incursion, however, and even if the characters tell Gartokkar what they know, he is fixated
                    on the idea that the Gray Ghosts are behind the disturbance, dismissing anything else as delusions,
                    ignorance, or outright lies.</p>
                <p>In his paranoia, Gartokkar wants the characters to confirm the Gray Ghosts' involvement and to bring
                    back whatever powerful magic the thieves used to cause the disturbance. The Keepers have identified
                    a Gray Ghost agent&mdash;a derro called @creature[Droki|OotA], who carries messages and supplies for
                    the thieves' guild (see "@creature[Droki|OotA]" in the "Blade Bazaar" section).
                    @creature[Droki|OotA] uses the West Cleft to contact his employers, and Gartokkar wants the party to
                    follow this derro and locate the Gray Ghosts.</p>
                <p>If the characters accept his offer, Gartokkar gives them a holy symbol of Laduguer after an acolyte
                    arrives with gold pins featuring @creature[Themberchaud|OotA]'s profile. The symbol and the badges
                    grant characters the right to travel beyond the Darklake District, though they are still limited
                    from moving freely in the city (see the "Flashing Badges" sidebar). If they refuse, they are turned
                    over to the Stone Guards for arrest and delivery to Overlake Hold.</p>

        <p>The Whorlstone Tunnels are a cavern system extending partially underneath Gracklstugh, away from the mines
            and passages the city's inhabitants use regularly. The derro savants who first found the tunnels didn't
            reveal their discovery to anyone, and to this day only a handful among the Council of Savants and the Gray
            Ghosts know about them.</p>
        <p>The long, gently curving tunnels have relatively regular dimensions. They are known for their unusual rock
            formations and abundant patches of fungi, and for being suffused with <em>faerzress</em> (see chapter 2).
        </p>
        <p>There are currently two factions using the tunnels for their own ends. The Gray Ghosts have an alchemical
            laboratory and a fungal garden supplying them with poisons, and the leaders of the guild conceal a secret in
            the form of a mysterious black obelisk in the farthest cave (see area 16). The other group is a budding cult
            of derro demon worshipers led by a renegade member of the Council of Savants. Sensing that the demon lords
            are somehow using <em>faerzress</em> to spread chaos and madness, the demon worshipers have begun conducting
            rituals to infect Gracklstugh. Intent on weakening the city and breaking the power of King Horgar
            Steelshadow V, the cultists plan to inflict a curse on the stone giants of Clan Cairngorm that causes them
            to grow second heads, driving them insane.</p>

                    these tunnels unimpeded, while a Small creature must squeeze to pass through them. Medium and larger

                <p>The Whorlstone Tunnels are suffused with <em>faerzress</em> (see "Faerzress" in chapter 2 for
                    effects). <em>Faerzress</em> has also altered the physical appearance of the complex, creating
                    spiral patterns on the walls and ceilings. These spirals are what give the complex its name. Because
                    of these weird spiraling patterns, saving throws to resist <em>faerzress</em>-induced madness are
                    made with disadvantage.</p>

                    foul water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become @condition[poisoned]. The
                    @condition[poisoned] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.

                    Fungi</span></h2>
            <p>The Whorlstone Tunnels are home to two unique kinds of <em>faerzress</em>-suffused mushrooms: bigwigs and
                pygmyworts. Any character who studies these mushrooms can identify their magical effects with a
                successful DC 15 Intelligence (@skill[Nature]) check, an @spell[identify] spell, or by trial and error.
                A single nibble of a mushroom alters a character's size by a few inches for 5 minutes, so characters
                foraging for food might discover the mushrooms' magic by accident. The size-altering effects of eating
                multiple bigwigs or pygmyworts aren't cumulative, although their durations are. These mushrooms lose
                their properties if they are taken outside the Whorlstone Tunnels for 1 hour or more.</p>

                <p>A bigwig is a four-inch-tall mushroom with a thin stem and a wide purple cap. A creature that eats
                    one can choose to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to not be affected by the mushroom's magic.
                    If the creature fails or forgoes the saving throw, it grows in size as though under the enlarge
                    effect of an @spell[enlarge/reduce] spell. The effect lasts for 1 hour. Ten minutes before the
                    effect ends, the creature feels a tingling sensation, at which point it can sustain its current size
                    by eating another wurple. The effect ends if the creature eats a pygmywort mushroom or is magically
                    reduced to its normal size (using the reduce effect of an @spell[enlarge/reduce] spell, for
                    example).</p>

                    that eats one can choose to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to not be affected by the
                    mushroom's magic. If the creature fails or forgoes the saving throw, it shrinks in size as though
                    under the reduce effect of an @spell[enlarge/reduce] spell. The effect lasts for 1 hour. Ten minutes

                    current size by eating another pygmywort. The effect ends if the creature eats a bigwig mushroom or
                    is magically enlarged to its normal size (using the enlarge effect of an @spell[enlarge/reduce]

                    phrases to himself at different volumes, failing to notice you. "@creature[Droki|OotA] is late! They
                    will be so angry! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Delays, blocks, procrastination, obstructions, pfah! No

            <p>@creature[Droki|OotA] (see <a href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#OotA,19">appendix
                    C</a>) has errands to perform. The characters can shadow him or chase him down, but both the
                Darklake District and the derro territories provide him with abundant places to hide and paths down
                which he can lose pursuers, and he knows them all. Inside the Whorlstone Tunnels, however, the derro is
                distracted by ever-present threats, giving the party the best chance to catch him. The characters can
                fight @creature[Droki|OotA] by the tunnels' entrance or follow him farther in, depending on their end
                goals. If they follow @creature[Droki|OotA], he goes to area 1a, eats a pygmywort mushroom, and
                disappears into a narrow tunnel (see the "Whorlstone Tunnels: General Features" sidebar).</p>
            <p>@creature[Droki|OotA]'s route takes him all around the Whorlstone Tunnels, and he's too scatterbrained to
                notice anyone following him. @creature[Droki|OotA]'s route is marked with red arrows on the map of the
                Whorlstone Tunnels. He eats a pygmywort mushroom whenever he needs to navigate a narrow tunnel. As he
                approaches areas 7 and 8, he eats a bigwig mushroom, reverts to normal size, delivers the Gray Ghost
                parcel (see "Treasure"), and collects his payment from Lorthio the @creature[duergar alchemist|OotA]
                (see area 8). @creature[Droki|OotA] then heads north to area 9, where he sneaks quietly around the
                central pool so as not to disturb its occupant. Upon reaching area 11, he greets the derro there before
                eating another pygmywort mushroom and traveling through the narrow tunnel leading to area 12. He eats
                another bigwig and reverts to normal size before making his delivery to the cultists in that area. After
                visiting the cultists, @creature[Droki|OotA] makes his way out of the Whorlstone Tunnels.</p>
            <p>If the characters hinder or attack @creature[Droki|OotA], he screams in fright and knocks his feet
                together, activating his @item[boots of speed]. If a chase ensues, resolve the outcome using the chase

                @creature[Droki|OotA] has advantage in his Dexterity (@skill[Stealth]) checks, as he knows the
                Whorlstone Tunnels well. If he loses the characters, he resumes his errands as if nothing had happened.
            </p>
            <p>If @creature[Droki|OotA] manages to escape, characters can pick up his trail by searching any area
                through which the derro passed and succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (@skill[Survival]) check.</p>

                    characters look through his satchel while he's still conscious, he throws an epic tantrum and
                    becomes intractable until knocked @condition[unconscious].</p>
                <p>@creature[Droki|OotA] is also obsessed with things happening where and when they should. If he is

                    characters altering fate by delaying him, and a good tactic to pressure him is to threaten to hold
                    him indefinitely. He prefers to escape than to fight, except if the characters take his satchel.</p>

                    delusion he volunteers if the characters question him. The hat might be worth something to a

            <p>The narrow corridor from the West Cleft opens into a long cavern lined with stalactites and stalagmites.

                <p>The glow of <em>faerzress</em> casts an eerie soft light across this cavern, swirling into spiral
                    patterns and casting dancing shadows from the jagged pillars lining the walls. The air smells and
                    tastes slightly metallic, and the sound around you is strangely muted. The dripping of water makes
                    no echo, as if you stood in open air.</p>

            <p>This place offers many hiding places for characters to lay in ambush. <em>Faerzress</em> prevents sounds

            <p>If the characters wait here for @creature[Droki|OotA], he appears after [[/r 2d12]] hours. In the middle
                of that wait, each character must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the character feels
                only a mild discomfort. A character who rolls a natural 20 on the save receives flashes of the future,
                gaining the benefit of the Lucky feat (see chapter 6, "@feat[lucky||Customization Options]," in the <a
                    href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB">Player's Handbook</a>) until the start of
                his or her next long rest. If the character already has the Lucky feat, he or she gains an extra 3 luck
                points to spend. On a failed save, a character sees disturbing images within the shimmering
                <em>faerzress</em> light and has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws until he or she
                finishes a short rest outside this area.

            <p>If the characters caught @creature[Droki|OotA] in Gracklstugh and brought him here, they must make the

                @creature[Droki|OotA] bides his time, giving nonsensical answers and hissing at the characters. He makes

                <p>As you venture into the cavern, a stench of rotting meat rises. The floor is carpeted with humanoid
                    remains in varying stages of decomposition, arranged in a spiral pattern around the cave's center.
                    An off-key humming comes from a hunched figure working busily at something on the floor.</p>
                <p>"Oh, there you are!" The figure is @creature[Buppido|OotA]. He wipes his hands on his vest and smiles
                    viciously. "I didn't expect you to find me here, with my shrine nearly finished! And power! My
                    faithful are finally honoring me! Are you...? Yes. Yes, I sense that you are ready to receive my

            <p>The humanoid remains on the floor make the entire cavern difficult terrain. Characters can identify the

            <p>@creature[Buppido|OotA] is a typical @creature[derro|MTF] and attacks the characters regardless of their
                intentions. On his first turn, he uses a bonus action to channel the power of this "shrine," raising six
                @creature[Skeleton||skeletons] to aid him. The undead assemble from the remains on the floor to form
                shambling, mismatched bodies. Each skeleton has two skulls, although this has no effect on its
                abilities.</p>
            <p>@creature[Buppido|OotA] fights with insane confidence and seems surprised if the party defeats him,
                screaming incoherent last words about the end of the world. The skeletons fight until destroyed even if
                @creature[Buppido|OotA] is defeated first.</p>

                <p>When the monsters are defeated, the @creature[ghost] of a deep gnome named Pelek pokes its head up
                    out of the ground, blinks, and then emerges fully. The ghost is friendly and tells the adventurers
                    that @creature[Buppido|OotA] killed him not too long ago, then chopped him into pieces to join the
                    other body parts in the shrine. Pelek explains how he was traveling from Blingdenstone when he fell
                    in with @creature[Buppido|OotA]. He knows little about the Whorlstone Tunnels, but he has observed a
                    shrunken derro with a funny hat (@creature[Droki|OotA]) entering and leaving the narrow tunnels.
                    Pelek doesn't know about the pygmywort mushrooms.</p>
                <p>Pelek asks the characters to take one or more parts of him to Blingdenstone and bury his remains
                    there, so that his spirit can rest. It's impossible to tell which body parts are his, and looking
                    around is a gruesome task that speaks loudly to @creature[Buppido|OotA]'s madness. Pelek recalls
                    that the strange magic that pervades the tunnels animated one of his severed hands, and it scuttled
                    away through one of the narrow tunnels. (Characters might encounter it in area 13.) Pelek points out
                    that characters can recognize the hand because it was wearing an obsidian ring. If the characters
                    need more reasons to go to Blingdenstone, Pelek adds that the svirfneblin who live there know many
                    ways to the surface.</p>

            <p>This pool is fed by a river that flows from the Darklake. The river carries many things from the
                subterranean lake, including the carcasses of countless creatures, fouling the pool (see the "Whorlstone

                    nearly one hundred feet away, but nothing can be seen beneath the surface of the black water.</p>
                <div class="float-clear">&nbsp;</div>

            <p>The water is heated by a thermal spring and pleasantly warm. However, the pool is disease-ridden. Any
                creature that starts its turn in the water must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
                save, the creature is infected with cackle fever (see "<a

            <p>The characters can try to get around the pool without swimming it, by using magic or climbing along the
                walls. Climbing the slippery walls of the cavern requires a successful DC 13 @skill[Athletics] check. On

                <p>The tunnel opens into a natural cave, wherein you see several fungal creatures dancing to a silent
                    tune. Three of them stand five feet tall, while the others are half as tall. One of the small ones
                    stands apart from the rest, its movements not nearly as frantic. Hunched nearby are two larger
                    creatures that resemble apes covered with mushroom growths and yellow mold.</p>

                with the party, it points this out. This group is composed of three @creature[Myconid Adult||myconid
                adults] and five @creature[Myconid Sprout||myconid sprouts]. @creature[Stool|OotA] recognizes one of the
                sprouts&mdash;the one not dancing&mdash;as his buddy, @creature[Rumpadump|OotA] (see "Development"). The
                ape-like creatures are two @creature[Quaggoth Spore Servant||quaggoth spore servants], and each one is
                covered with a patch of yellow mold (see "<a

                yellow mold spores until its mold patch is destroyed.</p>
            <p>The myconids are too swept up in their silent revelry to notice the characters. If the adventurers
                attack, the myconid adults fight fiercely while the sprouts run and hide. The spore servants join the
                fray if either they or the myconids are threatened. Otherwise, they remain motionless.</p>

            <p>If the characters try to communicate with the myconids, they release rapport spores so that everyone can
                speak telepathically. The leader of the myconids is an adult named Voosbur, who speaks on behalf of the
                others. Sharing thoughts with these sentient mushrooms is an odd and strangely intoxicating experience
                (and feels quite different than the rapport the characters might have shared with
                @creature[Stool|OotA]). Voosbur happily tells the party how its "troupe" was attracted by the special
                mushrooms in these tunnels, and it tells the characters about the magical properties of the pygmywort
                and bigwig mushrooms. Voosbur further explains that the myconids didn't wander into this area, but
                arrived here by traveling "through the Lady's dream." Voosbur describes "the Lady" as a powerful being
                that loves and guides all myconids. He offers to share "the Lady's gift" with the characters, allowing
                them to travel "through the Lady's dream" as the myconids do. Characters who accept the offer gain
                Zuggtmoy's gift (see the sidebar).</p>
            <p>If present, @creature[Stool|OotA] tells the characters it has no idea what Voosbur is talking about.
                Additionally, @creature[Sarith Kzekarit|OotA] starts to act erratically, trying to warn the characters
                away from the myconids, but unable to shake off the influence of Zuggtmoy's spores.</p>
            <p>The myconid sprout standing by itself is named @creature[Rumpadump|OotA]. It sends a subtle warning as a
                feeling of distress through its own rapport spores in response to Voosbur's offer, saying that the other
                myconids aren't behaving right.</p>

                    present or not, @creature[Rumpadump|OotA] can guide the characters to Neverlight Grove (see <a
                        href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#OotA,4">chapter 5</a>), where the
                    sovereigns might know of a way out of the Underdark. However, the myconid sprout is worried that
                    Voosbur's "strange spores" might have infected the rest of the myconids back home.</p>

                <p>Voosbur takes no offense if the characters refuse his offer to teach them how to travel "the Lady's
                    dream," simply bidding them farewell as the myconids resume their dancing. If the characters have
                    shown @creature[Rumpadump|OotA] any kindness, it asks their permission to join the party, especially
                    if @creature[Stool|OotA] is present. At the same time, Sarith breaks away from the party to join the
                    myconids. The drow turns one last time to give the characters a look of terror and despair before
                    his face loses all expression. He and the dancing myconids then enter a mushroom patch and use the
                    @spell[tree stride] ability granted by Zuggtmoy's blessing to vanish from sight.</p>

            <p>This tunnel juncture is blocked by a thicket of fungi. The thicket is an ecosystem unto itself, with its
                own challenges for those who wish to cross it.</p>

                <p>A dense fungi forest blocks your way, its tallest specimens growing some five feet high. Even as you
                    assess the best way to pass through it, a hissing sound starts to rise&mdash;like uncounted tiny
                    voices whispering in tongues you don't understand.</p>
                <div class="float-clear">&nbsp;</div>
            </div>
            <p>Although creepy, the hissing sound is harmless, caused by air whistling through perforated mushrooms in
                the thicket of fungi. The characters can cross this area by forcing their way through it, or by eating
                pygmywort mushrooms first to move through without disturbing the other fungi present. If the characters
                are chasing @creature[Droki|OotA], he uses the thicket to his advantage, eating a pygmywort to sneak his
                way across. At reduced size, he leaves no trail that normal-sized pursuers can follow.</p>
            <div class="float-clear">&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Tiny creatures can move through the thicket at no penalty. For Small and Medium creatures, the thicket is
                difficult terrain. While in the thicket, Tiny and Small creatures have half cover against Medium
                creatures and can hide.</p>
            <p>Creatures can negate the movement penalty by destroying the fungi before crossing the thicket. Each
                5-foot-square area of fungi has AC 10 and 10 hit points. Any attack that deals fire damage has a 50
                percent chance of igniting a torchstalk mushroom (see "Fungi of the Underdark" in chapter 2).</p>
            <p>The first time a Small or larger character reaches the tunnel intersection, two @creature[Swarm of
                Insects||swarms of insects] (centipedes) emerge from nests under the thicket and attack. Two more
                @creature[Swarm of Insects||swarms of insects] (spiders) arrive on the second round of combat, plus

                    <p>A myconid with Zuggtmoy's gift can, as an action once per day, release a 20-foot-radius cloud of
                        demon-tainted spores. Any other creature within the area that isn't already "blessed" with
                        Zuggtmoy's gift must make a Constitution saving throw, with a save DC of 8 + the myconid's
                        Constitution modifier + the myconid's proficiency bonus. A creature that forgoes or fails the
                        saving throw becomes infected. While infected with Zuggtmoy's gift, the creature gains the
                        ability to cast a special version of the @spell[tree stride] spell that has no components. This
                        spell allows the infected creature to move through patches of mold and fungi instead of trees.
                        Once it casts this spell, the infected creature can't cast the spell again until it finishes a
                        long rest.</p>
                    <p>Any creature infected with Zuggtmoy's gift has disadvantage on attack rolls against plant
                        creatures. In addition, whenever an infected creature finishes a short or long rest, it must
                        make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature lapses into a state of euphoric
                        bliss. While in this state, the creature can't take actions, bonus actions, or reactions, and
                        must use all of its movement to dance and twirl about. At the end of its turn, the creature can
                        repeat the saving throw, ending the euphoric bliss effect on a success.</p>
                    <p>A @spell[remove curse] or @spell[greater restoration] spell rids a creature of Zuggtmoy's gift.

                <p>The glow of <em>faerzress</em> shifts across this chamber as if pushed by an unseen wind. It flows
                    toward and around a large mesa and continues to spiral upward, but the ceiling of the cavern is too
                    dark and high to see. You hear murmurs and whispers coming from atop the mesa, which grow louder as
                    you approach. Its stacked levels resemble steps in a staircase, but a ramp running from top to
                    bottom provides an easy way up.</p>
                <div class="float-clear">&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Climbing the mesa reveals that its steps aren't concentric circles but the bands of a spiral, rising from
                the cavern floor to the mesa's top.</p>
            <p>The west wall has a noticeable crack leading to a narrow tunnel, which can be used as a shortcut to area
                7 if the characters are small enough to fit through it (see the "Whorlstone Tunnels: General Features"
                sidebar). @creature[Droki|OotA] uses this narrow tunnel on his travels.</p>
            <p>Characters at the top of the mesa hear the murmur of the chamber more clearly, and can recognize it as
                disparate sounds. They hear the rhythmic clank and roar of Gracklstugh's forges, the low rumble of
                @creature[Themberchaud|OotA]'s displeasure, the mad screaming of derro, and even hints and snatches of
                conversations. The <em>faerzress</em> in this place echoes the sounds produced in Gracklstugh above,
                creating a storm of noise.</p>
            <p>A character can use an action to focus on specific sounds but must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw,
                taking 7 ([[/r 2d6]]) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A
                character who fails the saving throw by 5 or more gains one level of madness (see "Madness" in chapter
                2) as his or her mind is overwhelmed by what is heard.</p>
            <p>A character who exceeds the saving throw DC by 5 or more can ask one question about Gracklstugh that can
                be answered by overhearing any sound or conversation occurring within the previous tenday in the city
                above or in the Whorlstone Tunnels. This can include discovering @creature[Droki|OotA]'s current
                location by following his insane mutterings.</p>
            <p>A character can focus on the sound in the chamber a number of times equal to his or her Wisdom modifier
                (minimum 1). After that, the character no longer has the ability to tell sounds apart.</p>

            <p>Three @creature[duergar] work here. They are members of the Gray Ghosts who have been assigned gardening
                duty. They attack as soon as they see intruders. If the characters arrive through the crack in the east
                wall (see "Fungi Pit"), they can hide among the fungi and try to catch the duergar by surprise. If the
                characters make a lot of noise in area 6 or force their way through the doors to the west, the duergar
                turn @condition[invisible] and attack as soon as the characters arrive.</p>
            <p>At the start of combat, two duergar use their Enlarge action while the third opens the valve on the
                copper tank and aims its nozzle at the characters. During the second round of combat on the same
                initiative count as the duergar, the @creature[duergar alchemist|OotA] from area 8 joins the fight. If
                the other duergar fall, the alchemist turns @condition[invisible] and tries to escape.</p>

                <p>The pit is 5 feet deep and filled with various kinds of fungi. It is difficult terrain for Small and
                    Medium creatures, and Tiny creatures have half cover while amid the fungi.</p>
                <p>A crack in the east wall forms the mouth of a narrow tunnel that leads from the floor of the pit to
                    area 6; see the "Whorlstone Tunnels: General Features" sidebar for more information on narrow
                    tunnels.</p>
                <p>The abundance of fungi in the thicket makes it easy to forage here. Among the common, inedible fungi
                    are the following edible and exotic fungi, most of which are described in chapter 2:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">

                <p>A character proficient and equipped with a poisoner's kit can also collect [[/r 1d6]] doses of
                    assassin's blood poison from the fungi pit (see "<a

                </h3>
                <p>The copper tank is a sprinkler used by the duergar to fertilize the fungi in the pit. The copper pipe
                    that extends from the tank is 10 feet long and can be turned so that its nozzle points in any
                    direction. The nozzle is pointed toward the pit by default.</p>
                <p>Any creature can use an action to open or close a valve on the tank, releasing a cloud of pungent
                    fertilizer that fills a 30-foot cube. The cloud grows 10 feet per side each round the valve remains
                    open. The cloud has the same effect as a @spell[stinking cloud] spell (save DC 12), but the effect
                    ends [[/r 1d4 + 1]] rounds after the valve is closed or the tank runs out of fertilizer. The tank
                    contains enough fertilizer to spray for 10 rounds.</p>
                <p>As an action or a bonus action, a creature can turn the pipe 90 degrees in any direction.</p>

                <p>If the characters keep any duergar alive for questioning, it takes a successful DC 16 Charisma

                    three questions total before the surviving duergar become incoherent and start frothing at the
                    mouth&mdash;a form of madness brought on by demon-tainted <em>faerzress</em>. Any spell or effect
                    that cures indefinite madness also restores a duergar's sanity (see "<a

                <p>The duergar stationed here are tasked with protecting the fungi garden and helping the alchemist in
                    his work. They use a trapdoor in area 8 to move between the Whorlstone Tunnels and the Darklake
                    Docks in Gracklstugh. They have been ordered not to explore the rest of the Whorlstone Tunnels,

                <p>This area is surprisingly clean and orderly, split into two levels connected by a ramp made from
                    zurkhwood planks. The upper level contains a fully furnished laboratory, while the lower level has
                    two bunk beds. The wall of the lower level is set with a closed door.</p>

            <p>Unless he is drawn to sounds of combat in area 7, a @creature[duergar alchemist|OotA] (see the sidebar)
                named Lorthio Bukbukken works on the upper level of this area. Lorthio's laboratory contains a work
                table, a desk, a case of shelves lined with vials, and a dome-shaped oven. All furnishings are made of
                zurkhwood except the oven, which is made of stone.</p>
            <p>The lower level is 10 feet below the laboratory and contains two bunk beds and two small chests, all made
                of zurkhwood (See "Treasure" below for information on the contents of the chests). The door is barred on
                this side and has closed peepholes at dwarf's-eye height. Opening the peepholes allows one to see into
                the room beyond. The bar is easily lifted from this side, but breaking down the door requires a
                successful DC 20 Strength check.</p>
            <p>The room east of the door is empty except for an iron ladder that climbs 60 feet to a stone trapdoor

            <p>The insane derro cultists have been buying cave bears from Underdark hunters and smuggling them through
                Gracklstugh. For what purpose is anyone's guess.</p>
            <p>A large gate made of iron bars blocks the northwest entrance and is usually locked. One of the derro
                cultists carries the key. The lock can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves'
                tools. A creature with a Strength of 20 or higher can force the gate open with a successful DC 25
                Strength check.</p>

                <p>The first thing you notice as you enter the room is a heavy, unpleasant musk in the air, coming from
                    cages assembled from scrap iron on both sides of the chamber. A spiral path circles into the center
                    of the room, marked off by small stone pylons.</p>
                <p>Two derro stand by a large cauldron in front of a tent near the cave's center. Both are talking while
                    apparently ignoring each other. In the cages, three hulking brown bears appear to be resting.</p>

            <p>The three cave bears (use the @creature[polar bear] statistics) are alert, despite appearances to the
                contrary. Characters hoping to sneak past them must succeed on Dexterity (@skill[Stealth]) checks
                contested by the bears' passive Wisdom (@skill[Perception]) score of 13. On their first turn, the
                cultists move to free the bears. Each cage is closed with a simple bolt that can be unlatched with an
                action. Once the first two bears are set free, the third bear breaks out of its cage on its own.</p>
            <p>A crack in the south wall leads to a narrow tunnel that wends toward area 12. Medium and larger creatures
                are too big to fit through this narrow tunnel (see the "Whorlstone Tunnels: General Features" sidebar).

            <p>Some of the cult's more powerful derro savants keep quasits as familiars, and the wee demons discovered
                this tunnel network. They use the tunnels as shortcuts to deliver messages across the areas of the

            <p>@creature[Narrak|OotA], a @creature[derro savant|OotA], belongs to a fringe group within the Council of
                Savants using demonology as a path to power. Since the arrival of the demon lords, he has gathered and
                bullied several apprentices to participate in rituals aimed to sow chaos in Gracklstugh.
                @creature[Narrak|OotA] knows the stone giants are a pillar of the Deepking's power, and that cursing
                them with Demogorgon's madness will be an appropriate first step toward delivering the entire city to
                the demon lord.</p>
            <p>The cage by the tunnel holds a @creature[death dog], watched over by a nervous @creature[derro|MTF]
                cultist. Atop the platform, @creature[Narrak|OotA] and four more @creature[derro|MTF] cultists are
                performing a ritual around the statue at its center. (Statistics for @creature[Narrak|OotA] and the
                derro can be found in <a href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#OotA,19">appendix
                    C</a>.) The cultists' chanting is punctuated with @creature[Narrak|OotA] calling out the name
                "Demogorgon!" Also atop the platform, resting comfortably in an fungi-filled alcove (and initially out
                of the party's view), is @creature[Narrak|OotA]'s bodyguard&mdash;a female @creature[ettin] named
                Grula-Munga.</p>
            <p>When intruders appear, the cultists cease their chanting and take up positions along the edge of the
                platform as Grula-Munga rises to her feet and picks up her weapons. At the same time, the cultist
                standing next to the cage releases the death dog. @creature[Narrak|OotA] continues his part in the
                ritual until the characters kill the death dog or one of the cultists, at which point he joins the
                battle. The door to the death dog's cage is held shut with a simple clasp and requires an action to
                open.</p>
            <p>If any of the quasits escaped from area 11, they warn the cultists that intruders are near. Otherwise,
                the characters might catch the cultists by surprise. The quasits remain @condition[invisible] and stay
                close to @creature[Narrak|OotA].</p>

                <p>Fungi is rampant throughout this area, growing in large patches on the floors and walls.</p>
                <p>Two thick fungi patches grow by each wall in the western tunnel. Clinging to the north wall is a

                <p>The crack in the floor by the east wall is surrounded by a thick fungus patch that is difficult

                <p>The cavern floor rises to form a natural 5-foot-high platform. A glowing ritual circle dominates the
                    top of the platform. Any non-derro that enters or touches the circle must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom
                    saving throw or gain one level of madness (see "Madness" in chapter 2). Whether the save succeeds or
                    fails, the creature can't be affected by the circle in this way again. In addition, non-evil
                    creatures within the circle have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.</p>
                <p>The statue within the ritual circle is 2 feet tall, weighs 100 pounds, and looks vaguely like a
                    crouching stone giant with a lump on its neck where a second head is beginning to form. The statue
                    is engraved with profane symbols, with the name "Dorhun" scribed in Dwarvish into its back. A
                    successful DC 16 Intelligence (@skill[Arcana] or @skill[Religion]) check allows a character to
                    recognize the profane symbols as being related to Demogorgon.</p>
                <p>A search of the platform uncovers a similar but broken statue near a locked iron chest and a pile of
                    books (see "Treasure" for more information on the chest and books). The broken statue is similar to
                    the statue in the circle, except it has the name "Rihuud" carved into its back and its second head
                    is fully formed. If Rihuud is dead, the broken statue turns to dust when the characters touch it. If
                    the characters spared Rihuud's life, a successful DC 12 Intelligence (@skill[Arcana] or
                    @skill[Religion]) check reveals that the second head is a conduit for the curse's magic, and that
                    removing it and returning it to Stonespeaker Hgraam in Cairngorm Cavern will allow the elder giant
                    to end Rihuud's curse.</p>

                <p>The tunnel west of this cavern contains a hidden pit (see "<a

                    weighing 50 pounds or more steps on it. (A character of reduced size might not weigh enough to break
                    the lid.) The pit is 10 feet deep, and its floor is covered by a patch of green slime (see "<a

                    of @item[Keoghtom's ointment] and a small leather bag containing 45 gp and 15 sp.</p>
                <p>The books have pages made from trillimac caps (see "Fungi of the Underdark" in chapter 2). They
                    contain the mad scribblings of @creature[Narrak|OotA] and his fellow derro savants. A character

                    through them; subtract [[/r 1d4]] hours if the character reads Dwarvish. At the end of this time,
                    the character knows that the books outline two rituals: one that causes a one-headed creature to
                    sprout a second head, and another that allows the grafting of a severed head onto a living creature.
                    The notes fail to mention that the ritual's caster must be suffering from some form of madness to
                    perform either ritual successfully.</p>

                    <em>faerzress</em> is everywhere, seeming to flow like fog around dark shapes shambling across the
                    pit floor. A single derro watches from atop a 15-foot-high ledge. A crack in the southeast wall of
                    the pit leads to a narrow tunnel and is flanked by mounds of fungi and offal.

            </div>
            <p>The pit is 15 feet deep, and the ledge that overlooks it is lined with pointy bits of scrap metal to make
                any climbing attempt perilous. A creature trying to reach the top of the ledge must succeed on a DC 12
                Strength (@skill[Athletics]) check. On a failed check, a creature takes 3 ([[/r 1d6]]) slashing damage
                and remains in the pit. The pit's floor is difficult terrain due to the many corpses and body parts
                strewn around.</p>
            <p>A single @creature[derro|MTF] stands on the ledge overlooking the pit, which contains seven shambling
                @creature[Zombie||zombies]&mdash;three duergar and four grimlocks. The grimlock zombies are drawn to
                noise, while the duergar zombies attack any living creatures they see in the pit. Meanwhile, the derro
                uses its crossbow to take shots at any living creatures it sees.</p>
            <p>A @creature[crawling claw] wearing an obsidian ring on one stubby finger (see "Treasure") lurks amid the
                offal mounds. These mounds are difficult terrain to Small and Medium creatures, and the fungi growing
                atop them provide cover to Tiny creatures. The shriveled gray hand once belonged to Pelek the
                svirfneblin (see "Development").</p>
            <p>The crack in the southeast wall between the mounds leads to a narrow, meandering tunnel, the floor of
                which is sunk below a foot of foul water. See the "Whorlstone Tunnels: General Features" sidebar for

            <p>The Gray Ghosts believe that the mysterious obelisk in this cavern is an important source of magical
                power, and they are intent on rebuilding it. The obelisk was broken long ago. However, shards of the
                obelisk that appear throughout the Underdark are magically absorbed into it as soon as they touch its
                metal surface. The leaders of the Gray Ghosts are obsessed with finding missing shards and completing
                this monolith, but not even they know what will happen when the obelisk is made whole again.</p>

                <p>After a steady upward climb, the tunnel opens into a huge, well-lit chamber. The glow of
                    <em>faerzress</em> and bioluminescent fungi compete with shafts of white light that fall upon
                    naturally formed shelves along the walls as well as a rocky mesa at the center of the cavern.
                    Crudely formed ramps connect the different levels of the mesa up to the height of its two topmost
                    tiers, which are linked by a sturdy bridge. Atop one of those tiers sits a large red egg. Atop the
                    other stands a 50-foot-tall obelisk made of smooth black metal with a few noticeable imperfections,
                    as though small parts of it were somehow chipped away.
                </p>
                <p>A female derro stands close to the obelisk, gently patting and stroking its surface. The obelisk
                    flashes once, the glow of <em>faerzress</em> around the cavern flaring in response. The derro
                    squeals with glee as she snatches an object up from the ground, then writes something down in a
                    small notebook.</p>

                growths reflecting and amplifying the light of the bioluminescent fungi growing on the walls. The
                characters realize this if they climb near the ceiling of the cavern, where the optical trick is easy to

            <p>The different levels of the mesa are separated by 10-foot-high cliffs. Climbing a cliff requires a
                successful DC 12 Strength (@skill[Athletics]) check. Pliinki, a mad @creature[derro savant|MTF] (see <a
                    href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#OotA,19">appendix C</a>), stands atop of the
                mesa. Hidden on a shelf above the cavern's entrance, a @creature[spectator] tasked with guarding this
                area sees the characters as soon as they walk 15 feet into the cavern. The spectator screeches an alarm
                and attacks, killing non-derro with glee. As it fights, it projects telepathic ramblings into the
                characters' minds, mostly dealing with how exciting it is to have intruders to kill and how even more
                exciting things will be when the obelisk is complete.</p>
            <p>Pliinki shouts crass obscenities at the characters in a raspy voice while commanding the spectator to
                dispose of them. Both she and the spectator fight to the death.</p>

                <p>Made from a black metal of alien origin, this monolith is perfectly smooth except for the cracks and
                    chipped-off edges where it was splintered by some unknown force. The obelisk is 15 feet per side at
                    its base, stands 50 feet tall, and tapers slowly to a pyramidal cap.</p>
                <p>Any character proficient in @skill[Arcana] can tell that the obelisk's fractures are leaking
                    quasi-magical energy. The character further understands that feeding magical energy into the obelisk
                    might activate its latent magic. Spending a spell slot of any level while touching the obelisk
                    activates it and teleports everyone on the mesa to a location in the Underdark just outside the
                    northwest gate of Gracklstugh.</p>
                <p>The character who expended the spell slot knows the teleport effect can be repeated, but that this
                    power is only temporary&mdash;a fluke due to the recent disruption of <em>faerzress</em> throughout
                    the Underdark. Both the potency and the nature of the effect could change within a week or two, and
                    this teleport effect likely bears no relation to the obelisk's actual purpose.</p>
                <p>If the characters took the lump of metal from @creature[Droki|OotA] or the Gray Ghosts, they notice
                    the obelisk is made from the same material. If the lump is touched to the obelisk, it is instantly
                    absorbed, repairing a crack on its surface.</p>

        <p>Errde Blackskull is true to her word, and she lets the characters leave the city freely if they fulfilled the

            characters in a position where they can at least avoid arrest in the city.</p>
        <p>Deciding the next step for the characters depends on what information or quests the characters picked up in
            Gracklstugh. Heading for Neverlight Grove (see <a
                href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#OotA,4">chapter 5</a>) or Blingdenstone (see <a

            steps, as both places hold the promise of a route to the surface world. Alternatively, the characters can
            try their luck in the Labyrinth or the Wormwrithings.</p>
        <p>Some of the quests the characters complete have the potential to change the power structure of Gracklstugh.

                lava bathe the palace facade in a hellish glow, and the thick stone walls bristle with iron turrets and
                battlements.</p>
            <div class="float-clear">&nbsp;</div>
        </div>
        <p>There appears to be no one guarding the palace, but this is an illusion. All of the palace guards are
            @condition[invisible], and characters who observe the palace for some time can hear duergar guards in heavy
            armor marching to and fro.</p>
        <p>Two hundred @condition[invisible] @creature[Duergar Stone Guard|MTF|duergar stone guards] (see <a
                href="https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#OotA,19">appendix C</a>) protect the palace and
            its king. Fifty stand at attention in perfect rows before the palace, ready to cut down anyone who
            approaches the palace gates unescorted. Another fifty watch from the turrets and battlements. One hundred
            more stand guard in the palace and comprise the Deepking's honor guard.</p>

            <p>Characters who befriend Stonespeaker Hgraam or complete quests for Errde Blackskull or Gartokkar Xundorn
                can use their newfound influence to gain an audience with the Deepking. Characters escorted to the
                palace by Hgraam, Errde, or Gartokkar are admitted inside and led past rows of @condition[invisible]

                <p>Lava pours down troughs cut into the black basalt walls of this vast hall. The heat is oppressive,
                    and the air reeks of sulfur. Thick black columns support the heavy ceiling, and at the far end of
                    the hall stands an iron throne atop a polished obsidian dais. A crowned duergar encased in armor
                    sits on the throne. Next to him stands a royal consort wearing a gown made of gold coins.</p>

            <p>An @condition[invisible] @spell[wall of force] stands between the Deepking's dais and the characters.
                Whether the Deepking is of a mind to fight the demon lords is up to you, although like many other
                duergar in the city, @creature[Deepking Horgar Steelshadow V|OotA|Horgar Steelshadow V] has been touched
                by the demon lords' madness. Roll on the Indefinite Madness table in @table[indefinite madness||chapter

            <ul class="rd__list">

                <li class="rd__li ">He speaks Draconic, Giant, and Dwarvish.</li>

            <p>The Deepking's royal consort is a @creature[succubus] in the guise of Shal, a female duergar. The
                succubus is a loyal servant of the demon lord Graz'zt (see appendix D). Her only task is to make sure no
                one tries to rid Horgar of his madness. The gown she wears was a gift from Horgar. It weighs 75 pounds
                and is worth 750 gp.</p>

                <p>If the characters expose the succubus as a fiendish spy and help restore Horgar's sanity, the
                    Deepking becomes friendly toward them and tries to set them against the drow, whom he blames for the
                    spreading madness.</p>
