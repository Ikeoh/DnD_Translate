    <p>Embora seu nome possa evocar imagens de um único corpo de água subterrâneo, o Lago Sombrio é uma rede de rios subterrâneos, túneis naturais e canais que conectam inúmeras cavernas e câmaras preenchidas por água. Esta vasta hidrovia se estende por mais de cem milhas de largura, com tetos que em alguns lugares têm milhas de altura e profundidades insondáveis.</p>
    <p>Há muito tempo, engenheiros duergar estenderam e alargaram muitas das passagens interconectadas do Lago Sombrio. Eles também construíram eclusas para elevar e baixar embarcações a diferentes níveis dentro dele, abrindo grandes porções da rede para viagem. Muitas criaturas do Underdark são experientes em navegar pelo Lago Sombrio, incluindo os kuo-toa—humanóides com aparência de peixe, conhecidos por sua obsessão insana em desvendar os padrões secretos do Underdark. Ainda assim, é melhor confiar em um guia kuo-toa do que tentar atravessar o Lago Sombrio sozinho e se perder para sempre dentro dele.</p>
    <p>Os aventureiros podem usar o Lago Sombrio para alcançar muitos destinos no Underdark. Mais importante, viajar pela água torna difícil para seus perseguidores drow rastreá-los. A cidade kuo-toa de Sloobludop está localizada na borda leste do Lago Sombrio e é uma fonte potencial de embarcações e ajuda na navegação. Mas, enquanto procuram por esses recursos, os personagens aprendem sobre poderes terríveis soltos no Underdark—pior do que os drow, os kuo-toa, ou qualquer outra ameaça desse reino sombrio.</p>

        <p>Os aventureiros precisam encontrar uma maneira de cruzar o Lago Sombrio em direção ao seu destino final—sair do Underdark e voltar ao mundo da superfície. Eles podem tentar encontrar um guia ou contratar uma passagem em Sloobludop, mas outras possibilidades também podem se apresentar.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="231"><span class="entry-title-inner">Modos de Viagem</span></h2>
            <p>Os aventureiros podem encontrar diferentes maneiras de cruzar o Lago Sombrio, dependendo de quanto tempo eles o atravessam e quem ou o que eles encontram ao longo do caminho.</p>
            <p>Como não há vento no Underdark, toda viagem pela água envolve ou remar a 2,4 km por hora, ou flutuar com as correntes predominantes a 1,6 km por hora. Os personagens podem trabalhar em turnos para remar mais de 8 horas por dia, mas tripular um barco por mais tempo do que isso é considerado uma marcha forçada (veja o <a href="https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#PHB,8,travel%20pace,0">capítulo 8</a> do <em>Livro do Jogador</em>).</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="232"><span class="entry-title-inner">Barco</span></h3>
                <p>A maioria das embarcações que navegam nas águas do Lago Sombrio são navios de zurkhwood pilotados pelos kuo-tua ou pelos duergar. Esses barcos são equivalentes a barcos de quilha (veja a tabela @table[Owning a Ship; Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles||Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles] no capítulo 5 do <em>Guia do Mestre</em>).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="233"><span class="entry-title-inner">Balsa Improvisada</span></h3>
                <p>Os personagens também podem construir balsas improvisadas usando materiais disponíveis. Por exemplo, o chapéu de um cogumelo zurkhwood gigante pode ser escavado para fazer uma corácula equivalente a um barco a remo, mas com metade dos pontos de vida de um barco a remo (veja a tabela @table[Owning a Ship; Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles||Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles] no capítulo 5 do <em>Guia do Mestre</em>). Esta é uma atividade de artesanato realizada no tempo livre, exigindo um dia de trabalho por balsa.</p>
                <p>Uma embarcação ainda mais improvisada pode envolver um personagem sentado em um barril flutuante ou outro recipiente à prova d'água, seja manobrando com um remo ou seguindo a corrente. Tal embarcação tem uma velocidade de 1 milha por hora, requer uma tripulação de 1, não permite passageiros ou carga, e tem CA 11, 20 pontos de vida e limiar de dano 0.</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="234"><span class="entry-title-inner">Natação</span></h3>
                <p>Nadar no Lago Sombrio é uma péssima escolha, dado o número de criaturas perigosas que o habitam. Verifique a possibilidade de um encontro com criaturas a cada hora em que os personagens estiverem nadando, em vez de a cada 4 horas de viagem. Um personagem que estiver nadando deve ser bem-sucedido em um teste de resistência de Constituição CD 10 para cada hora de natação ou ganhar um nível de &Reference[condition=exhaustion].</p>
                <p>Personagens que não estão ativamente nadando, mas simplesmente se agarrando a algo que flutua (incluindo os destroços de um barco ou balsa), podem ser levados pela corrente a uma velocidade de 1 milha por hora. Verifique os encontros com criaturas a cada hora em que os personagens flutuam na água, e peça testes de Constituição contra &Reference[condition=exhaustion] a cada 8 horas de viagem.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="235"><span class="entry-title-inner">Outras Opções</span></h3>
                <p>Viajantes podem combinar modos de viagem, e um grupo grande pode precisar de vários barcos ou balsas. Uma criatura com velocidade de natação (incluindo um personagem polimorfado) pode viajar sem risco de fadiga por até 8 horas, e pode até servir como montaria para uma criatura menor que ela. Criaturas que respiram na água (ou que não respiram) podem nadar debaixo d'água ou até mesmo caminhar pelo fundo de seções rasas do Lago Sombrio, mas precisam de &Reference[rule=darkvision] ou de uma fonte de luz para enxergar.</p>

                        <p>O Lago Sombrio é um imenso labirinto de lagos, cursos d'água e canais que conectam inúmeras cavernas e câmaras. Algumas dessas cavernas são enormes, com água de profundidade imensurável e tetos abobadados muito além do alcance de qualquer luz. Outras são estreitas, com apenas alguns metros de espaço entre o teto e a superfície da água. Algumas estão completamente submersas, sendo navegáveis apenas por aqueles que conseguem respirar debaixo d'água.</p>

                        <p>Sem o céu ou as estrelas para se orientar, qualquer travessia bem-sucedida do Lago Sombrio depende da familiaridade com sua intrincada rede de cavernas, passagens e correntes. Navegadores experientes sabem como encontrar e ler runas antigas de duergar esculpidas ao longo dos túneis do Lago Sombrio, embora a maioria desses "sinais de trânsito" esteja quase apagada pela passagem do tempo. Esse conhecimento é algo que leva anos, se não décadas, de exploração do Lago Sombrio para adquirir. Aqueles sem habilidade para navegar no Lago Sombrio (incluindo os aventureiros) devem usar mapas ou guias. Se os personagens conseguirem adquirir um mapa, eles podem fazer testes de Sabedoria (&Reference[skill=Survival]) normalmente para evitar se perder.</p>

Grande parte da água do Lago Sombrio é imprópria para beber, tornando importante buscar fontes limpas de água, como nascentes, que alimentam o lago.</p>

                <p>A small island rises from the water ahead. An island with no hostile creatures makes a good place for the party to take a long rest. There is a 50 percent chance that the island has one or more types of fungi growing atop it (see "@UUID[.0000000000000001#fungi-of-the-underdark]{Fungi of the Underdark}" in chapter 2).

                <p>Loose rocks fall from the ceiling above. Each character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be hit by a chunk of falling stone for [[/r 2d6]] bludgeoning damage. If the characters are traveling in a boat or raft, their vessel takes [[/r 2d6]] bludgeoning damage for each successful save; in other words, each rock that misses a character hits the boat or raft instead.

The characters can push the vessel back into the water with a successful DC 10 group Strength (&Reference[skill=Athletics]) check.

Stalagmites jutting up from the bottom of a tunnel are hidden just below the waterline. Spotters must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom (&Reference[skill=Perception]) check to notice the "stone teeth," allowing the vessel's crew to attempt a DC 12 group Dexterity check to navigate through them. If the group check succeeds, the vessel passes through unscathed. Failure to notice or navigate through the stone teeth deals [[/r 6d6]] piercing damage to the boat or raft.</p>

    <p>Sloobludop is a kuo-toa village on the eastern edge of the Darklake. From a distance, it looks like a massive tangle of reeds stretching up into the darkness, lit by glowing spots of phosphorescence. Upon closer approach, a series of rickety towers can be seen, lashed together by rope and plank bridges set in haphazard patterns. Even above ground, the kuo-toa build in line with their three-dimensional aquatic sensibilities, constructing their "great city" as if it were underwater.</p>
    <p>Sloobludop simmers with religious fervor and sectarian tension. While many of the kuo-toa still worship the goddess Blibdoolpoolp, a faction has shifted its worship to Leemooggoogoon the Deep Father, a vision influenced by the manifestation of the demon prince Demogorgon from the depths of the Darklake. Initially, the archpriest of Blibdoolpoolp tolerated this—but then his own daughter declared herself an archpriest of Leemooggoogoon, and the cult began to grow.</p>

        <p>Sloobludop spreads out along the rocky shore of the waters of a broad cavern lake, with high fences of woven netting to the north and south of the village boundaries.</p>

            <p>Sloobludop's cavern is almost entirely dark except for a few spots of dim light from phosphorescent fungus and coral, or from glowing cave-fish glands. The kuo-toa recoil from areas of bright illumination, becoming hostile if bright light is brought among them.</p>

            <p>Bridges and platforms are haphazardly strung throughout the city, connecting various levels of structures with each other as well as crisscrossing open spaces. Characters can move at a normal pace across the platforms and bridges, but this puts strain on their poor construction. Whenever one or more characters move at normal speed across a bridge or platform, roll a [[/r d6]]. On a roll of 1, a bridge flips or breaks to drop characters to the platform below, or a platform tilts to tip the characters into the water. These areas can be navigated safely by treating them as &Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain}.</p>

            <li class="rd__li ">They need a boat (and possibly a guide) to navigate the Darklake. Travel along the waterways of the Darklake is an excellent way to throw off their drow pursuers (see @UUID[.0000000000000001#drow-pursuit]{chapter 2} for details).</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">Staying a short while in Sloobludop can provide a respite from pursuit, since the drow are reluctant to provoke the kuo-toa needlessly. Reduce the pursuit level by 1 while the characters consider their next move.</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">The characters need supplies and equipment, and hope the kuo-toa might be willing to trade for whatever they can offer. Alternatively, the characters might try to steal what they need from the kuo-toa.</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">Shuushar might point out any of the previous reasons, or wish to go to Sloobludop to rejoin his people, feeling he has important guidance to offer them.</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">Shuushar might not be the only one with "higher guidance." One or more characters might experience dreams or visions guiding them toward Sloobludop—not realizing that such dreams are simply further manifestations of the madness growing in the Underdark.</li>

                <p><span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p44</span></p>
                <p>Though the kuo-toa are mad, at least some of that madness comes from an utterly alien mind-set. Although amphibious air dwellers, the kuo-toa still largely behave as aquatic creatures. Thus, much of what they do on land is a bizarre approximation of life under the water.</p>
                <p>Kuo-toa names are a long series of gargling syllables, and their voices have a bubbly, gargling quality. However, the kuo-toa communicate as much through gesture as speech. They have difficulty standing still, and are prone to quick, darting movements. They pace constantly, walking in circles around creatures talking to them. A kuo-toa priest speaking to a group of followers doesn't stand at a podium but wanders aimlessly while the crowd follows like a school of fish.</p>
                <p>Kuo-toa prefer their leaders to be physically above their subordinates. (If no dais or platform is available for leaders, they have been known to literally stand on top of prostrate underlings.) However, leaders tend to dwell on the lowest levels of buildings because these are considered the safest areas in a settlement, due to their proximity to the water.</p>
                <p>Since the kuo-toa are fishlike, they lack eyelids. This isn't only unnerving in conversation (a kuo-toa never blinks), but it also means that kuo-toa all look the same sleeping as awake—and virtually all kuo-toa sleepwalk, making things even more confusing. There is a 25 percent chance that any individual kuo-toa the party encounters in Sloobludop is sleepwalking, ignoring everyone around it and moving in a shuffling gait from place to place.</p>

            <p>If Shuushar accompanies the party, the kuo-toa monk can be helpful in communicating with his people at Sloobludop. However, keep in mind that Shuushar is either a heretic or a holy man depending on which kuo-toa he's speaking to, and how they view things at that particular moment. The mysterious monk could serve as an ace in the hole to help the party out, or he could just as easily cause trouble with his stubborn refusal to acknowledge his fellow kuo-toa's religious obsessions as anything other than "dangerous illusions," combined with his preference for nonviolent solutions.</p>

The fish-folk immediately attack, but their tactics show that they are attempting to capture the characters. The kuo-toa leave any fallen opponents &Reference[condition=unconscious] at 0 hit points, intending to bring them back to Sloobludop as live offerings to the Deep Father. They bind prisoners with tough cords of gut, each with 2 hit points and requiring a successful DC 17 Strength check to break.</p>

            <p>On the way to Sloobludop after the previous encounter, the characters run into another kuo-toa patrol, this one made up of six @creature[kuo-toa] and two @creature[Kuo-toa Monitor||kuo-toa monitors], led by the @creature[kuo-toa archpriest] Ploopploopeen. If the characters are prisoners of the first kuo-toa patrol, the newcomers ambush them and fight to free the characters. Otherwise (or after the fight), Ploopploopeen attempts to communicate in Undercommon, then casts @spell[tongues] if none of the characters speak it. Read the following:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                <p>"I am Ploopploopeen, archpriest of the Sea Mother Blibdoolvpoolp. She answers my prayers by delivering you. Help us, and you will be rewarded for your service."</p>
                <div class="float-clear">
                    <p></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>If the characters talk with Ploopploopeen, the archpriest explains his intentions as the kuo-toa escort the party to Sloobludop. If the characters refuse, the kuo-toa attempt to capture them, as with the previous patrol.</p>
            <p>Ploopploopeen explains that the inhabitants of Sloobludop have lived in harmonious service to the will of the Sea Mother for some time. Oh, there were occasional "visionaries" who stirred up trouble (at this, he might cast a walleyed glance at Shuushar) but nothing of any great concern. A few weeks ago, Bloppblippodd, Ploopploopeen's own daughter, experienced a powerful vision of "Leemooggoogoon the Deep Father," proclaiming him the new god of her people. She has backed up her claims with a great increase in her magical power, and new followers have flocked to her.</p>
            <p>"We are split in two," Ploopploopeen explains, "fighting among ourselves." The followers of the Deep Father have been making an increasing number of offerings on his altar—killing blood sacrifices then casting bloody chum into the waters of the Darklake, where it is consumed by... something.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
            <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="281"><span class="entry-title-inner">Baiting the Hook</span></h3>
            <p>The archpriest of the Sea Mother tells the characters he wants to use them as bait. The archpriest of the Deep Father needs humanoid sacrifices, and the party represents a prize collection in that regard. Ploopploopeen will offer the characters as a "token of peace and reconciliation" to get closer to the archpriest of the Deep Father—except the adventurers will not be helpless prisoners, but infiltrators. Ploopploopeen wants the characters to disrupt the upstart faction's rituals, allowing his true believers of the Sea Mother to cut off the head of the cult. The archpriest promises that the characters will be "well rewarded" for their aid.</p>
            <p>If the characters refuse, Ploopploopeen tries to turn them over anyway, still using them as bait to get his own kuo-toa loyalists closer to his daughter's cult. However, he no longer depends on or supports the characters as allies, leaving them to survive on their own.</p>
            <p>No matter whether the characters approach the final encounter as willing participants or prisoners, the kuo-toa make no effort to bind them or take their weapons, believing in the power of their superior numbers and the divine might of their competing gods.</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset ">
                <h4 class="entry-title-inner"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="282">A Kuo-Toan Koan</span></h4>
                <p><span class="rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset">p46</span></p>
                <p>The kuo-toa are aquatic creatures. As such, they have no real need for the boats they use to ply the Darklake, even as boating remains a significant part of their culture.</p>
                <p>It might well be that the kuo-toa's former masters—the mind flayers—used them as ferry pilots and navigators in the Underdark, and the fish-folk continue to do so out of habit or some deep-seated need. Certainly, their relative usefulness to the other races of the Underdark has served the kuo-toa well. Only the duergar have shown any interest in navigating the waters of the Darklake on their own, and not even they do it as well as the kuo-toa.</p>
                <p>There is a persistent myth among the inhabitants of Sloobludop that the maze of tunnels, passages, and pools of the Darklake is a kind of meditation—a spiritual journey. Kuo-toa who navigate that maze long enough will awaken to a great revelation for their people. As with many of the strange beliefs of the kuo-toa, this one might only need time to become a reality.</p>

        <p>Sloobludop is enclosed to the north and south by outer "walls" of heavy netting with sharp bone hooks woven into them. In the middle of each wall is a gate through which creatures can safely pass. Any creature wishing to crawl through the netting can do so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (&Reference[skill=Acrobatics]) check. On a failure, the creature takes [[/r 1d8]] piercing damage and becomes &Reference[condition=restrained] in the netting, requiring a successful DC 12 Strength check as an action to break free.</p>
        <p>Stationed outside each gate are four @creature[Kuo-toa Whip||kuo-toa whips]. They confront anyone who approaches. Party members escorted by other kuo-toa can pass through the gate unchallenged. If the characters are unescorted, any kuo-toa they meet attempt to capture them. Roll a [[/r d20]]. On a 1–7, captives are taken to area 3. On an 8–18, captives are taken to area 4. On a 19–20, the guards are evenly split and immediately begin to brawl for the right to take the characters as prisoners.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
        <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="284"><span class="entry-title-inner">2. Docks</span></h2>
        <p>A half-dozen kuo-toan keelboats are moored here. Although kuo-toa will negotiate terms for ferrying the characters across the Darklake, none leave without permission (see below). Party members can attempt to steal one or more of the boats, but doing so requires a successful DC 16 Dexterity (&Reference[skill=Stealth]) check (and the kuo-toa are able to sense &Reference[condition=invisible] creatures). The kuo-toa pursue any stolen boats, intending to capture the thieves as offerings to appease their gods.</p>
        <p>Five groups of three @creature[Kuo-toa Monitor||kuo-toa monitors] led by a @creature[kuo-toa whip] patrol the platforms at the water's edge. They ensure no vessel enters or leaves without submitting to "auguries" to determine if a crew's actions are pleasing to the god of the hour—in this case, the Deep Father.</p>
        <p>The auguries consist of a half-hour ritual, during which the whip casts bones, shells, and other tokens and reads the resulting omens. Roll a [[/r d20]]. On 1–8, the whip finds the omens favorable; on 9–18, he finds them unfavorable; and on 19–20, the auguries are unclear, and the whip feels the need to consult the archpriest of the Deep Father (area 4).</p>
        <p>If the characters met or spoke with the archpriest of the Deep Father before coming here, the whip automatically refuses their request to leave.</p>

        <p>When the characters arrive here, on their own or escorted, read the following to the players:</p>
        <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
            <p>A nine-foot-tall statue stands here. Its body is roughly carved from some kind of wood in the shape of a humanoid female, its head and forearms formed from the severed head and claws of a giant albino crayfish. These parts are lashed on with strands of gut, and emit an overpowering stench of rotting shellfish. Shells, brightly colored stones, mushrooms, and rotting fish are piled at the statue's feet and strung in garlands around its neck. Four stern kuo-toa slowly circle the statue, alert and on guard, while a few others mill about, gazing up at the statue and bowing repeatedly while chanting.</p>
            <div class="float-clear">
                <p></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>All creatures that come here are expected to make an offering to the Great Sea Mother Blibdoolpoolp. A successful DC 13 Intelligence (&Reference[skill=Religion]) check recalls that Blibdoolpoolp is a scavenger goddess, meaning that discarded and recovered items are worthy offerings—and the more personal the better. Regurgitating at the goddess's feet is considered a sincere show of faith (and a behavior faithful kuo-toa might display if the characters wait long enough).</p>
        <p>Four @creature[Kuo-toa Monitor||kuo-toa monitors] guard the statue at all times, and there are always [[/r 2d4]] @creature[kuo-toa] worshipers around it offering prayers. Currently the shrine is tended by Glooglugogg, a @creature[kuo-toa whip] and son of Ploopploopeen, the archpriest of the Sea Mother. The guards are wary of anyone, including other kuo-toa, due to recent tensions.</p>
        <p>Ploopploopeen claims a small hovel adjacent to the shrine, where he is attended by four @creature[kuo-toa]. This is where he brings the characters if they are his "guests."</p>

            <p>The home of the archpriest contains a closet full of "offerings" taken from less fortunate travelers or culled from the depths of the lake. This includes 500 cp, 2,000 sp, 150 gp, 27 pp, a strand of matched pearls worth 1,000 gp total, two @item[Potion of Healing||potions of healing], a @item[potion of water breathing], and a @item[spell scroll] of @spell[light].</p>

        <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
            <p>The idol to Leemooggoogoon the Deep Father consists of a large hide cut roughly in the shape of a manta ray and stretched out on cords between two support poles. A dead, splayed-out manta ray is pinned to the center of the hide. Two dead octopuses are draped across the top, their tentacles pinned and artfully arrayed, their heads tied together and painted with red and blue pigments. The idol reeks of decay, and the broad stone altar below the idol is stained dark with blood.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Six @creature[kuo-toa] work at the altar, cleaning up and arranging offerings. Klibdoloogut, a @creature[kuo-toa whip] dedicated to the Deep Father, stands in front of the altar with two @creature[Kuo-toa Monitor||kuo-toa monitors]. Offerings are usually living creatures killed on the altar, although an offering of one's own blood also satisfies the whip. Humanoids other than kuo-toa are immediately taken into custody to be brought before the archpriest of the Deep Father, who summarily condemns them to be sacrificed.</p>
        <p>Bloppblippodd, a female @creature[kuo-toa archpriest] of the Deep Father, lives on the bottom floor of a squat hovel near the altar. She is a bloodthirsty sadist absolutely assured that her divine vision will raise her in glory to rule her people. Bound and gagged against the far wall is a duergar prisoner (see "@UUID[.0000000000000002#the-offering]{The Offering}").</p>

            <p>Bloppblippodd's hovel contains wealth accumulated since her rise to power: 1,000 cp, 500 sp, 290 gp, an embroidered silk handkerchief with a spider design worth 25 gp, three azurite gems worth 10 gp each, a duergar-made bronze cup worth 25 gp, and a silver choker with a spider design worth 30 gp.</p>

        <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="289"><span class="entry-title-inner">The Offering</span></h2>
        <p>If allowed to do so, Ploopploopeen brings the characters to his quarters near the Shrine of the Deep Mother. There they meet Glooglugogg, who loudly tells his father in Undercommon that he sees no need for outsiders to be involved in sacred matters. The archpriest dismisses his son's concerns with a negligent wave, telling Glooglugogg that he must flow with the currents of the goddess's visions. The whip relents but throws the characters a hostile glare.</p>
        <p>Within the hour, twelve @creature[kuo-toa] led by a @creature[kuo-toa monitor] arrive at Ploopploopeen's quarters. The archpriest of the Sea Mother admits the monitor and informs him that he, his whip, and the prisoners will accompany them to see the archpriest of the Deep Father. They are escorted to the altar of the Deep Father near the docks, where Bloppblippodd awaits them. Describe the scene to the players as given in that area, then read the following boxed text; if none of the characters speak Undercommon, the exchange is gibberish to them, though Shuushar can translate.</p>
        <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
            <p>The archpriest of the Sea Mother steps forward across the span of the altar toward the kuo-toa waiting for him there. "The time has come," he says, "for us to acknowledge your divine vision and welcome it. I have brought these as offerings." He gestures toward all of you, standing within a circle of guards behind him. "Will you not accept them?" "You are wise, father," the younger archpriest replies. "I accept your offering in the name of the Deep Father. May their blood nourish and strengthen him!" A burbling cheer goes up from the surrounding kuo-toa, their fists raised in the air.</p>
            <div class="float-clear">
                <p></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The followers of the Deep Father are already preparing to sacrifice a bruised and bedraggled @creature[duergar] named Hemeth—an arms smuggler who was looking to cut a deal with one or both factions of the kuo-toa, but instead found himself captured for his trouble. He's willing to cooperate with the characters to save his own skin, and will even return the favor given the opportunity (see chapter 4, "@UUID[JournalEntry.YtptJRu3dY0jWKuP.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000003]{Gracklstugh}").</p>

        <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="290"><span class="entry-title-inner">The Ritual</span></h2>
        <p>Kuo-toa parade around the altar in a wide circle as they chant. Part of their path sends them splashing and wading through the shallows of the Darklake. The characters quickly can't tell one faction of fish-folk from the other, but they see the archpriest of the Sea Mother and his whip moving toward the altar.</p>
        <p>Bloppblippodd calls for the sacrifices to be brought forth, and one @creature[kuo-toa] per character jumps to do her bidding. They prod the characters with their spears to herd them toward a slight depression 20 feet from the altar, with a large grate at its center. The characters can see that the stonework of the depression is stained with the blood of innumerable sacrifices, and they can hear the gentle lapping of the Darklake coming up through the grate. The chanting grows louder.</p>
        <p>When the sacrifices are brought forward, Bloppblippodd gestures toward the altar, whereupon her father suddenly attacks, striking her with his scepter. Kuo-toa loyal to him surge forward to attack, while the guards that brought the characters forward stand in shock. They are @status[surprised] and can't move or take an action on their first turn of the combat, and they can't take reactions until that first turn ends.</p>
        <p>As the two @creature[Kuo-toa Archpriest||archpriests] and their followers fight, the characters can intervene on either side or attempt to slip away during the melee.</p>
        <p>On round 3 of the fight, characters notice kuo-toa crying out and flailing in the shallows of the Darklake. Several are pulled under or strike at unseen foes beneath the surface. The water foams red with blood.</p>
        <p>Dozens of @creature[ixitxachitl|OotA] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.YtptJRu3dY0jWKuP.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000019]{appendix C}) are responsible for the attacks in the water. They have been drawn by the kuo-toa ritual and feast on any creatures they can reach, including party members in the water. The sudden frenzy sets a wave of panic through the kuo-toa. The young archpriest calls out "Leemooggoogoon!" just as her father strikes a final, fatal blow, dropping her before the profane altar. (If any character is also engaging the archpriest of the Deep Father, allow that character to strike the final blow.)</p>

        <p>Although Bloppblippodd falls, the ritual still achieves a terrible success. Read the following:</p>
        <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
            <p>Another sound rises above the burbling cries of the kuo-toa. The dark surface of the water farther out bubbles and begins to foam. A thick, oily tentacle bursts forth, followed by another. Then two monstrous heads break the surface, both resembling hideous, angry baboons with wickedly curved tusks. Both heads are attached to a single torso, and the monster's red eyes burn with bloodlust and madness. The creature rising from the Darklake must stand thirty feet tall or more, with water cascading down its back and shoulders. Upon reaching its full height, the great demon throws back both its heads and roars!</p>
            <div class="float-clear">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The kuo-toa offerings and the fervor of his worshipers in the Darklake have drawn the attention of @creature[Demogorgon|MTF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.YtptJRu3dY0jWKuP.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000020]{appendix D}). Upon witnessing the rise of the Prince of Demons, each party member must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or gain a level of madness (see "@UUID[.0000000000000001#madness]{Madness}" in chapter 2). The kuo-toa become &Reference[condition=incapacitated] for [[/r 1d10]] minutes, crying out "Leemooggoogoon!" over and over again.</p>
        <p>Demogorgon wades toward Sloobludop, heads roaring and gibbering, tentacles flailing and smashing the water. In 4 rounds, he comes within reach of the shoreline and lashes out, smashing docks and sending bodies flying with each sweep of his tentacles. When the demon lord attacks, some kuo-toa recover their wits enough to flee, while others cower, &Reference[condition=paralyzed] with fear.</p>

            <p>Hopefully, the players exercise the better part of valor and flee as soon as they see the demon lord. If they confront him, they are almost certainly doomed. Fortunately for them, Demogorgon is focused on smashing the kuo-toa settlement and pays little heed to the puny creatures fleeing from him. The characters thus have a good chance of getting away if they act quickly. They might first need to deal with companions overcome by bouts of madness, however, and they need to decide how they intend to escape.</p>

The @creature[ixitxachitl|OotA] attack anyone in the water, but most are occupied with slaughtering kuo-toa fleeing into the Darklake. A near miss from one of Demogorgon's tentacles might require each character to make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (player's choice), with failure indicating that the character has been thrown overboard by a wave.</p>
