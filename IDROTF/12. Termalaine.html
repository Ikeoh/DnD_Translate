    <p>Fundada por colonos Calishite que apreciavam a beleza, Termalaine é amplamente considerada a cidade mais pitoresca de Icewind Dale, se espalhando a partir da costa de Maer Dualdon e limitada ao norte e oeste por altos pinheiros. Seus edifícios incorporam esculturas de magos, homúnculos, tigres e gênios sorridentes.</p>
    <p>Para a maioria dos visitantes, o encanto da cidade é dissipado assim que eles sentem as garras e dentes gelados do vento frio que sopra do norte, cortando suas camadas de roupa. Termalaine foi construída no caminho deste terrível vendaval, que continua bem além da cidade para assediar os pescadores na metade sul do lago.</p>
    <p>Além de pescadores, construtores de navios e scrimshanders, Termalaine é o lar de mineiros que colhem gemas de um complexo de cavernas situado em uma colina baixa ao norte e leste do assentamento. Seus esforços são prejudicados por criaturas do Underdark que ocasionalmente encontram seu caminho até a mina. Sempre que tais criaturas são descobertas, a mina é selada e os moradores da cidade esperam até que um grupo de mercenários ou aventureiros possa ser contratado para limpá-la.</p>

            <p><em>Taverna à beira do cais</em></p>
            <p>Os pescadores de Termalaine normalmente terminam seus dias aqui, sentados em bancos perto de uma das longas lareiras do edifício para aquecer os pés enquanto enchem a barriga com sopa condimentada. Belos trabalhos de escultura em marfim são pendurados nas paredes.</p>
            <p>Vernon Braig (meio-orc de bom alinhamento neutro @creature[commoner]), o proprietário e chef da Concha Azul, conhece alguns dos caçadores e armadilheiros em Lonelywood, e ocasionalmente um trenó desce a trilha norte com um saco de lebres ou um pedaço de alce, cortesia de um dos amigos de Vernon. Nessas noites, as lareiras da Concha Azul estão cheias de carne assando, e os clientes ficam até mais tarde e cantam mais alto, aproveitando os bons momentos enquanto duram.</p>
            <p>Personagens que demoram na taverna provavelmente ouvirão um ou dois rumores, que você pode determinar rolando na tabela de Rumores das Dez Cidades (veja "@UUID[.0000000000000001#ten-towns-rumors]{Rumores das Dez Cidades}").</p>

            <p><em>Pousada</em></p>
            <p>O Lado Leste é onde a maioria dos visitantes da cidade se hospeda. O que parece de fora como casas separadas acaba sendo uma única estrutura com quartos conectados por passagens subterrâneas, com aconchegantes acomodações para hóspedes no porão.</p>
            <p>A dona da pousada é Marta Peskryk (humana de bom alinhamento legal @creature[commoner]), uma adolescente esguia que passa grande parte do seu tempo cuidando de seu pai acamado, Clyde, um pescador aposentado e não combatente. Enquanto realiza suas tarefas diárias, Marta canta a seguinte música para si mesma:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset ">
                <p>À frente do vento do inverno ela veio—</p>
                <p>A linda mulher sem nome;</p>
                <p>Envolvida em um manto forrado de pele vermelha,</p>
                <p>Para o lago gelado ela fugiu;</p>
                <p>O vento a perseguiu da mesma forma—</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Se perguntada sobre a canção, Marta relata a seguinte história. Cinquenta anos atrás, uma mulher misteriosa em um manto vermelho forrado de pele parou no Eastside a caminho de Lonelywood. Como a mulher estava sozinha e assustada, os donos da pousada - um par de aventureiros aposentados que por acaso eram os avós de Marta - tentaram consolá-la. A mulher deu-lhes um anel como pagamento por sua hospitalidade. Pouco tempo depois, um vento uivante irrompeu na pousada e jogou a mulher ao redor como uma boneca de pano. Os donos da pousada intervieram, dando à mulher tempo para escapar. O vento maligno deixou os avós de Marta inconscientes antes de retomar sua caçada. Essa foi a última vez que alguém viu a mulher.</p>

        <p>The characters can pick up this quest if they start the adventure in Termalaine or shortly after they arrive in town. As they trudge through the streets, they see a young boy standing on a box, yelling about various local happenings, including the recent evacuation of workers from a nearby mine that has been overrun by kobolds. A reward of 50 gp is offered to anyone who can rid the mine of the pesky dragonlings.</p>
        <p>When the characters investigate, they discover that all is not what it seems. The kobold leader has been possessed by a ghost, and a grell has infiltrated the mine, setting the kobolds on edge. The characters can either try to parley with the kobolds and get them to leave the mine peacefully, or they can rid Ten-Towns of their presence permanently and try to deal with the grell on their own.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="463"><span class="entry-title-inner">A Minor Issue</span></h2>
            <p>Darmo Mazlu, a human boy, stands on a box and yells out the latest news to passersby, most of whom ignore him:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                <p>A boy wrapped in heavy winter clothes shouts the news of the day as people pass by. When you approach, the boy cries, "The gemstone mine is closed because of monsters! Speaker Masthew is offering fifty gold to anyone who clears it out!"</p>
                <div class="float-clear">
                    <p></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>If the characters express interest, Darmo tells them they can find the town speaker, Oarus Masthew, at the Blue Clam. The boy also has some information about the mine, including its location. He doesn't know much about the history or the particulars of the mine, but he knows it's important for Termalaine and its closing means a significant loss of income.</p>
            <p>The characters can make the half-hour trek to the mine without visiting Oarus, or they can go to the tavern to see the speaker. If the characters decide to ignore the quest, the mine remains closed for several weeks before the kobolds mysteriously vanish, enabling the miners to return. After the mine reopens, it isn't long before workers start disappearing one by one—victims of the grell.</p>

            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                <p>Outside the tavern, you see two bundled-up humanoids talking to one another. When they see you, one waves to you in a friendly manner, then says, "You seem entirely too prepared for trouble. Are you here about the mine?"</p>
                <div class="float-clear">
                    <p></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The town speaker, Oarus Masthew (lawful good half-orc @creature[veteran]), explains that a group of kobolds crept into the mine a few days ago, entering from the surface and forcing the miners to abandon their jobs. No one was killed, but the kobolds are too dangerous for the miners to deal with. He also reveals that a human miner went missing a few days before the kobolds showed up, prompting other miners to fear that a monster must have crawled up from the Underdark. Oarus thinks it's possible that the miner fell down the central shaft, which is deep enough that his body would never be found.</p>
            <p>One piece of information that Oarus fails to mention is that he ordered the town militia to clear out the mine three days ago. The militia refused to deal with the problem for what amounts to political reasons. Senior officers in cahoots with Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr of Targos are determined to oust Masthew as town speaker and replace him with one of their own in a special election. They're convinced that the closing of the mine and the resulting economic woes will turn Masthew's political supporters against him.</p>

            <p>The entrance to the mine is in the woods northeast of town. The characters can follow a trail from Termalaine and be there in 30 minutes. When they arrive, the area around the opening appears devoid of life:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                <p>The entrance to the gem mine is an open tunnel in a hillside. Empty carts are parked near the entrance, next to which a crude wooden sign has been propped up. Written on the sign in charcoal are the words "Kobolds only!" in Common.</p>

                <p>The mine's meandering tunnels have 7-foot-high ceilings. Wider areas tend to have higher ceilings, the average being 12 feet. The mine has no light sources.</p>
                <p>The most prominent feature of the mine is a wide vertical shaft that descends thousands of feet into the Underdark. This shaft predates the mine, and efforts to seal it off have been unsuccessful. It was by this route that the grell invaded the mine in search of food.</p>

                <p>Looking down, the characters see nothing but darkness. Characters using @sense[darkvision] or a light source brighter than a candle can see, if they look up, the underside of the walkway in @UUID[.0000000000000011#m5.-underdark-shaft,-level-1]{area M5} (on level 1). If the characters failed to notice the two kobolds clinging to the underside of the upper structure earlier, they spot the little saboteurs from this 30-foot-lower vantage point.</p>

                    <p>This rope-and-pulley mechanism is used to transport miners and ore between the two platforms. A crank mounted to each platform allows the bucket to be shuttled from one side to the other. A person inside the bucket can forgo the cranks and pull themselves across by tugging on the suspension rope. The bucket is large enough to hold one Medium creature or two Small creatures. It takes 1 round for the bucket to cross the gap between the platforms.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Dealing 5 acid, fire, or slashing damage to the rope causes it to snap. If the rope is cut, the bucket and its contents fall down the shaft, likely gone forever. A character in the bucket when the rope breaks can grab one end of the severed rope with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, thus averting certain death.</p>

                    <p>Lurking in this dusty tunnel are three skittish kobolds. One of them carries a threadbare satchel and wears a fake pair of dragon wings made of thin wood and tattered white cloth. This kobold immediately raises its hands in surrender, saying in Common, "We mean you no harm. Please don't hurt us."</p>
                    <div class="float-clear">
                        <p></p>

                </div>
                <p>Two of these three @creature[Icewind Kobold|IDRotF|Icewind kobolds] (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#kobolds]{appendix C}) are nervous bodyguards named Vott and Zurk. The one wearing the fake wings and doing the talking is Trex, the leader of the group. If one or both of the kobolds from @UUID[.0000000000000011#m9.-hungry-kobolds]{area M9} fled from there, they lurk deeper inside the tunnel behind Trex and his bodyguards.</p>
                <p>Trex is possessed by a @creature[ghost], though the characters won't know this until the ghost shows itself (see "Janth's Ghost" below). Speaking in fluent Common, Trex explains that he and his fellow kobolds sought refuge in the mine after being chased out of the foothills of Kelvin's Cairn by a yeti. The miners got scared and ran off before Trex could explain that the kobolds meant no harm. As long as Trex is possessed by the ghost, he has an impressive vocabulary and speaks only Common.</p>
                <p>If the characters engage Trex in conversation, he makes a proposition:</p>
                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud ">
                    <p>"The everlasting winter has made the wilderness unsafe for my kind, and the preternatural cold dulls our wits. Please, we only want a place to stay so we can keep out of this horrible weather. We can work, and we won't cause trouble. Termalaine would be richer for having us."</p>

                </div>
                <p>Any character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (@skill[Insight]) check can tell that Trex is lying. The ghost controlling Trex wants safe access to Termalaine so that it can possess someone more powerful and influential than a kobold.</p>
                <p>If the characters agree to take the kobolds in the mine back to Termalaine, the kobolds act as their allies.</p>

                    <p>In life, Janth Alowar was a neutral human sage who devoted himself by cataloguing the flora of Icewind Dale. He and his guide were killed and decapitated by a yeti in the foothills of Kelvin's Cairn two years ago, and his restless spirit has lingered. The kobolds happened upon the ghost while searching for shelter during a blizzard, allowing it to possess Trex without the other kobolds' knowledge.</p>
                    <div class="rd__spc-inline-post">
                        <p></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>The threadbare satchel carried by Trex once belonged to Janth. It contains clumps of moss, lichen, and shrubbery gathered from the foothills of Kelvin's Cairn and the surrounding tundra. None of the samples are valuable, but the ghost is very possessive of the collection and won't give up its satchel without a fight.</p>
                    <p>Janth's ghost can be laid to rest by destroying the satchel—its last connection to the Material Plane. The ghost otherwise remains as close to the satchel as possible. If the satchel is taken from Trex and discarded, the ghost forsakes its current host and remains near the satchel, hoping to possess someone else.</p>
                    <p>If Trex is killed, the ghost appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the kobold's body. On its next turn, the ghost tries to possess one of the characters—preferably one who can take up its satchel.</p>

                    <p>A fossilized skull partially juts out of the east wall of this small cave, five feet off the ground. The skull has larger than normal eye sockets, a curious ridge between the eyes, nothing that would pass for a nose, and four small holes where one would expect to see teeth.</p>

                <p>The skull embedded in the wall is that of a mind flayer that came up from the Underdark thousands of years ago. How it became lodged in the stone is anyone's guess. Any character who examines the skull and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (@skill[Arcana]) check concludes that it came from a mind flayer. Any attempt to pry the skull from the stone causes it to shatter and fall away, revealing a crystal shard where the illithid's brain would have been.</p>

                    <p>The crystal shard lodged inside the fossilized mind flayer skull is a @item[psi crystal|IDRotF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.P7d2UEime7l0L2VE.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000022]{appendix D}). The psychic trauma that the mind flayer endured when it died caused the crystal to form in its mind. A character can use a miner's pick to pry loose the psi crystal.</p>

Determine the result secretly, then convey this information only to the character's player. The madness does not end until the character is no longer attuned to the <em>psi crystal</em>. While the madness lasts, the character can hear a repeating telepathic distress signal put out by an illithid ship that crashed in the mountains and track the signal to its source (see "@UUID[.0000000000000012#id-ascendant]{Id Ascendant}"). The only way to block the signal is by ending the character's attunement to the <em>psi crystal</em>.</p>

He encourages the characters to spend a few days in Termalaine while he conducts the investigation.</p>
            <p>If there are no more kobolds in the mine and the grell has likewise been dealt with, Oarus returns to the characters the next day and pays them 50 gp for their services. If Trex is still in the mine and Janth's ghost wasn't laid to rest, Oarus returns to Termalaine possessed by the ghost. If the kobolds are gone but the grell remains, Oarus is killed by the grell and doesn't return, leaving the town without a speaker. If the grell is still in the mine when it reopens, a handful of local miners disappear over the next few days before the decision is made to close the mine for good.</p>
            <p>If the characters bring the kobolds to Termalaine, Oarus is initially hesitant to let them stay in the town. After hearing about their willingness to work, he decides to give them a chance and offers them menial jobs. The kobolds, eager to prove themselves, turn out to be good workers. The townsfolk tease them at first, but eventually the kobolds win them over. Janth's ghost, if it hasn't been laid to rest, finds someone else to possess, causing Trex to revert to his skittish, much less intelligent self.</p>
