    <p>The fortress of Grimskalle, built by frost giants, now serves as the abode of Auril the Frostmaiden.</p>
    <p>Auril the Frostmaiden has retreated to a floating island of ice and snow and turned a skull-shaped fortress formerly occupied by frost giants into her abode. Her presence makes the island the most frigid place in the Far North. The cold is unbearable for many visitors, whose corpses become part of the island's frozen decor.</p>
    <p>Ideally, the characters should be 7th level when they visit the island, although there's nothing stopping them from exploring it at lower levels. They might visit the island for either of the following reasons:</p>
    <ul class="rd__list">
        <li class="rd__li ">@creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF], a member of the Arcane Brotherhood, invites the characters to join her on an expedition to the island (see @UUID[.0000000000000014#vellynnes-quest]{chapter 4} for more information).</li>
        <li class="rd__li ">The characters come to the island on their own, hoping to put an end to Icewind Dale's everlasting winter.</li>

        <p>The characters can locate and obtain both @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF] and @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF]'s stolen @item[professor orb|WDMM] without confronting the Frostmaiden. But if the characters want to end the Everlasting Rime right here, right now, they can do so by slaying Iskra, the Frostmaiden's roc (without which Auril can't cast her nightly spell that keeps the sun at bay), or by facing Auril in battle and defeating all three of the Frostmaiden's forms sequentially.</p>

        <p>Titanic icebergs bob in a churning black sea of unknown depth, crashing into one another with destructive results. Floating amid these mountains of ice, shrouded by mist, is Auril's island. Using sheer force of will, the Frostmaiden can anchor the island or cause it to slowly drift about. For that reason, the island doesn't appear on maps of the Sea of Moving Ice.</p>

            <p>The characters can reach Auril's island in any of the following ways:</p>
            <ul class="rd__list">
                <li class="rd__li ">Hitch a ride on Angajuk, the awakened sperm whale (see "@UUID[.0000000000000012#angajuks-bell]{Angajuk's Bell}").</li>
                <li class="rd__li ">Travel to Revel's End (see "@UUID[.0000000000000012#revels-end]{Revel's End}") and book passage on a ship bringing supplies or convicts to the prison.</li>
                <li class="rd__li ">Ask the Akannathi goliaths (see "@UUID[.0000000000000012#skytower-shelter]{Skytower Shelter}") to loan them some trained griffons and then fly to the island on the griffons' backs.</li>

            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Via Angajuk the Sperm Whale" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1024"><span class="entry-title-inner">Via Angajuk the Sperm Whale</span></h3>
                <p>The characters can get directions to the pier where Angajuk can be summoned and befriended. @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] knows the location of Angajuk's pier; if she's with the party, she proposes that they spend a night in the town of Bremen and set out to Angajuk's pier in the morning.</p>
                <p>Angajuk can travel up to 25 miles a day but takes a leisurely, meandering route to Auril's island, resulting in a three-day journey. The whale is submerged for most of the trip, allowing the characters to see what life is like in the frigid depths. Like a tour guide, the whale takes its passengers within sight of spectacular underwater attractions, including shipwrecks, storm giant castles, and cyclopean ruins from the bygone empire of giants known as Ostoria.</p>
                <p>After delivering the characters safely to the island, Angajuk is willing to circle the island until the characters are ready to leave, provided they don't make the whale wait for too long. Auril's roc poses a threat to Angajuk, so the whale surfaces only when it must.</p>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1025"><span class="entry-title-inner">Via Ship from Revel's End</span></h3>
                <p>The prison of Revel's End has easy access to the Sea of Moving Ice. On the downside, captains who are brave enough to take their ships into the Sea of Moving Ice expect to be well compensated; characters can expect to pay 1,000 gp or more for a one-way trip to Auril's island, or five times that amount if they expect the ship to wait for them and take them back to Revel's End.</p>
                <p>One such captain is Sharlasta Stormsword, a retired pirate (lawful evil human @creature[bandit captain]) who commands the <em>Ravenous</em>, a sailing ship with a crew of twenty well-trained scalawags (@creature[Bandit||bandits]). The ship's port of call is the city of Neverwinter. Despite her checkered past, Captain Stormsword is one of the most reliable privateers working for the Lords' Alliance today, and she rarely turns down a chance to earn a little extra coin on the side. Each dawn, she tosses a barrel of fish and a cask of whiskey into the sea as offerings to Umberlee—a practice that keeps the evil sea god on her side.</p>
                <p>When the characters arrive at Revel's End, there's a [[/r 1d100]]{10 percent} chance that the <em>Ravenous</em> is moored at the pier and is in the process of offloading crates of supplies as well as [[/r 1d4]] convicts in shackles. Characters who aren't so lucky must wait [[/r 1d10]] days for the ship to arrive.</p>
                <p>The <em>Ravenous</em> can travel 50 miles a day. But finding Auril's island while avoiding close encounters with icebergs and ice floes takes five days. Under no circumstances will Captain Stormsword or her crew leave their ship to explore the island.</p>
                <p>If you need a map of the <em>Ravenous</em>, use the ship map in <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,11">appendix C</a> of the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.</p>

                <p>The goliaths of Skytower Shelter agree to loan the party members one griffon apiece if one of these conditions is met:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">A goliath character who is a member of the Akannathi clan convinces the Akannathi chieftain to help the party by succeeding on a [[/save ability=cha dc=13]] (&Reference[skill=Persuasion]) check.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Skytower Shelter's griffons are safe to ride, but they are trained to return home after delivering the characters to their destination. Convincing a griffon to remain on Auril's island while the characters explore the place requires a successful [[/save ability=wis dc=13]] (&Reference[skill=AnimalHandling]{Animal Handling}) check, and even then, the griffon won't stay for more than 24 hours due to the unbearable cold.</p>
                <p>The goliaths don't have enough griffons to carry @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF]'s kobold entourage, which forces Vellynne to leave her charges behind. The kobolds are happy to stay with the goliaths, but the goliaths quickly dispose of the undead ones.</p>

            <p>Regardless of the means by which the characters travel to the island, assume that they arrive near the ruined dock on the island's southeast arm. This puts them on the far side of the island from where the wizard Nass Lantomir met her doom.</p>
            <p>Read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players, whether the characters approach the island by sea or air:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                <p>The fog through which you've been traveling thins enough for you to see fifty-foot-high cliffs of solid ice ahead. Jutting out of the water off the coast are the bare, weather-beaten masts of sunken ships.</p>
                <p>Ahead, you can make out what appears to be a partially shattered dock carved out of ice. As you get closer, it becomes obvious that the dock was made for giants.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The ruined ice dock and the shipwrecks in the vicinity are the only features of the island immediately visible. Fog prevents the characters from seeing the island's other features at a distance.</p>
            <p>Characters flying on the backs of griffons can bypass the dock and find somewhere else on the island to land. But if one or more griffons come within 200 feet of the fortress of Grimskalle while Auril's @creature[roc] is atop the fortress, it takes to the air and tries to kill the griffons so that their riders fall. (See @UUID[.0000000000000015#g9.-crowned-rooftop]{area G9} in this chapter for more information about the roc.)</p>

                <p>Frost giants fashioned this dock out of ice and built it to endure, yet sections of it have broken away and fallen into the sea. Because the dock was scaled for frost giant longships, characters approaching by water must climb to reach the top of it. Those without magic or climbing gear can do so with a successful [[/save ability=str dc=15]] (&Reference[skill=Athletics]) check.</p>
                <p>At the back of the dock, giant-sized steps climb to the top of the 50-foot-high cliffs. A 20-foot-wide path made from bricks of ice leads from the dock to the fortress of Grimskalle, as shown on map 5.1.</p>
                <p>An @creature[ice mephit] named Söpo is perched at the top of the ice stairs and is willing to serve as a guide for new arrivals, not out of kindness but to alleviate its boredom. If the characters approach by air, Söpo intercepts them. Characters who speak Aquan or Auran can communicate with Söpo verbally; if there's no one in the party who can understand it, the mephit communicates using gestures as best it can.</p>
                <p>Söpo enjoys watching other creatures suffer. Initially, however, it acts as a guide to earn the characters' trust, pointing out areas where characters might slip on a patch of ice or get bonked on the head by a low-hanging icicle. Vellynne's snowy owl familiar, if it's present, senses the mephit's cruel intent. Söpo and the owl have an instant dislike for one another.</p>
                <p>Söpo tries to get the characters to explore every part of the island by sharing the following information with those who can understand its words:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">The shipwrecks that surround the island are full of loot waiting to be claimed.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">The last ship to visit the island crashed off the coast of the island's northwest arm. One survivor managed to pull herself out of the frigid water and climb to the top of the island, but she died before getting any farther.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">The Frostmaiden has created beautiful ice sculptures all over the island. One would weep at the very sight of them if it were not so cold as to make tears freeze in one's eyes.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">There are yeti caves on the east side of the island. An abominable yeti called Korgrah lives among them.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If shooed away, Söpo continues to follow the party but doesn't meddle. Whenever some misfortune befalls a character, however, the mephit lets slip a raspy cackle.</p>

                <p>The ice that makes up the island fans out under the water, creating shelves ranging from 20 to 50 feet beneath the surface. Atop these shelves, lodged amid jagged spires of submerged ice, are the wrecks of several ill-fated sea galleons and ancient frost giant longships, as shown on map 5.1.</p>
                <p>Characters who can withstand the frigid water might want to explore these sunken wrecks. For each site searched, roll a [[/r d20]] and consult the Shipwreck Discoveries table to determine what the characters find. No discovery can occur more than once; if you get the same result twice, reroll or choose a different possibility.</p>

                <p>Nass Lantomir outsmarted her rivals in the Arcane Brotherhood by partnering with a pirate captain before leaving Luskan for Icewind Dale. After stealing @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF]'s @item[professor orb|WDMM], Nass fled to the coast to make her rendezvous with the pirate captain's galleon, the <em>Wicked Eddy</em>. The ship found Auril's island the hard way: by crashing into the ice shelf that runs beneath it. As the vessel took on water, Nass alone swam to shore, only to die of frostbite on a snow-covered bluff overlooking the <em>Wicked Eddy</em>'s sunken hulk.</p>
                <p>Characters who search the northwest arm of the island find Nass's frostbitten corpse and much more:</p>
                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                    <p>Half-buried in snow near the edge of a bluff is a humanoid corpse clad in cold weather clothing. Clutched in one of its hands is an orb made of smoky-gray quartz.</p>
                    <p>A white weasel bursts from the snow near the corpse and stares at you with its beady eyes. A voice rings out. "Ye gods, I was afraid no one would find us!" The sound isn't coming from the weasel, but from the orb.</p>
                </div>
                <p>If anyone tries to pry the orb from the dead wizard's fingers or otherwise disturbs the remains, @creature[Nass Lantomir's ghost|IDRotF] (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#arcane-brotherhood]{appendix C}) appears above the corpse and tries to possess someone on its first turn. If her ghost successfully possesses a party member, Nass tries to turn the characters against Vellynne (if she is present) and join them in their search for @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF]. If the ghost gets what it wants, it shares the following information, some of which Nass acquired when she was alive with the aid of @item[Spell Scroll||spell scrolls] of @spell[divination] used before her death:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">The Arcane Brotherhood sent four wizards to find the lost Netherese city of Ythryn, which has lain under the Reghed Glacier for nearly two thousand years. (Nass is willing to divulge the identities of the other three wizards, if asked; see the "@UUID[.0000000000000021#arcane-brotherhood]{Arcane Brotherhood}" section in appendix C for details.)</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">@item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF] contains a spell or ritual that can open a passage through the Reghed Glacier to the lost Netherese city.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Worshipers of Auril have hidden @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF] in a frost giant fortress called Grimskalle, situated atop the small mountain in the middle of the island.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The ghost can't move more than 200 feet from the place where Nass died unless it takes possession of a host. If it's forced out of a host's body when the body is more than 200 feet from where Nass died, the ghost instantly returns to that spot, regardless of whether the wizard's corpse is still there.</p>
                <p>If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points, it fades away, only to reappear 24 hours later in the place where Nass died. The ghost is doomed to haunt the island until it acquires @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF], whereupon it achieves its final rest and ceases to exist.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Weasel Familiar" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Weasel Familiar.</span> The arctic @creature[weasel] is Zelennor, Nass's fey familiar. @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] would recognize it as such. Anyone who can cast the @spell[find familiar] spell knows that a familiar typically vanishes when its creator dies, but Zelennor has somehow formed a bond with Nass's spectral undead form. If Nass's ghost is destroyed, even temporarily, the weasel ceases to exist.</p>

Nass's other gear went down with the Wicked Eddy.</p>
                    <p>The <em>professor orb</em>, which calls itself @item[Professor Skant|IDRotF], is happy to be found. See @UUID[.0000000000000022#appendix-d:-magic]{appendix D} for a description of Professor Skant. If she is present, Vellynne tries to reclaim the orb but won't fight the characters for it. In addition to its areas of expertise, Professor Skant knows what must be done to reach the city of Ythryn, having discussed plans at length first with @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] and then with Nass Lantomir. If they part company with the orb's previous two owners, the characters can use Professor Skant to help them identify the steps they must take to reach Ythryn, if that's their goal.</p>

                <p>There are several of these locations on the island, including one the characters will come across if they follow the brick path from the ruined dock:</p>
                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                    <p>Through the blowing snow, you see a grand assembly of ice sculptures across a snowy field at the foot of the mountain in the center of the island. Closer examination reveals that the sculptures are completely faithful to their subjects: bears, elk, saber-toothed tigers, wolves, yeti, remorhazes, white dragons, and other creatures of the North. No mortal hand could create such wondrous works.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The Frostmaiden creates these ice sculptures. If the characters damage any of them, two bad things happen.</p>
                <p>First, the Frostmaiden makes her presence known, manifesting nearby as a 7-foot-tall woman made of snow. She cries out, "Defilers!" and points a finger at them. Each character who defiled a sculpture must succeed on a [[/save ability=con dc=20]] saving throw or gain vulnerability to cold damage for the next 24 hours. A character who has resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Because of her weakened state, the Frostmaiden can't create another such manifestation until the next dawn.</p>
                <p>Second, Auril telepathically awakens Korgrah, an @creature[abominable yeti] (see @UUID[.0000000000000015#i5.-yeti-caves]{area I5}), and commands it to hunt down and kill the party. This yeti's sense of smell is so acute that it can track the characters by scent regardless of where they are on the island.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="I5. Yeti Caves" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1037"><span class="entry-title-inner">I5. Yeti Caves</span></h3>
                <p>Dotting the eastern slope of the ice mountain atop which Grimskalle sits are seven shallow caves, each one occupied by a hostile yeti that feeds on seals, walruses, and other island visitors. The seven @creature[Yeti||yetis] attack all at once, though a character with the Littlest Yeti secret (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000020]{appendix B}) might attempt to communicate with them in hopes of improving their attitude.</p>
                <p>If all seven yetis are slain, their angry spirits awaken Korgrah, an @creature[abominable yeti] that slumbers under the ice and snow, unless Korgrah has already been killed. The abominable yeti explodes from an ice-covered cyst lets out a howl that can be heard across the island, and hunts the characters until it or they are dead. This fearsome yeti can't be mollified by a character with the Littlest Yeti secret.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Inside the Caves" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">

                    <p>A ten-foot-tall wall of ice has broken down in a few places, leaving gaps through which you can see what appears to be a huge garden of ice sculptures.</p>
                </div>
                <p>This area is a graveyard where Auril displays creatures that have died on the island from the extreme cold. Each creature is encased in a thick coat of ice, preserving its remains. Amid scores of humanoid cadavers—pirates, hunters, adventurers, worshipers, and others who fell prey to Auril's cold embrace—are the frozen forms of hares, foxes, and other small animals.</p>
                <p>An @creature[ice troll|IDRotF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}) found its way here and destroyed parts of the outer wall. It has also been gnawing on some of the corpses. Auril isn't concerned about the intrusion, since this place is much less important to her than her ice statues are. If the characters loiter in the garden, the ice troll attacks and fights to the death.</p>
                <p>@creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] and Nass Lantomir are both aware of the magical properties of ice troll hearts (as described in the "@creature[Ice Troll|idrotf]" entry in appendix C) and can share this information with the characters once the ice troll is killed.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Grimskalle was constructed for a frost giant queen named Vassavicken and is filled with the remnants of her reign, including her corpse. Auril has claimed the stronghold to serve her own worldly needs.</p>

                <p>Auril uses this space as her personal sanctuary. Depending on how this encounter plays out, you might need to reference one or more of Auril's stat blocks in @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}.</p>
                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                    <p>This room contains wrecked furnishings that suggest it was once used as a frost giant's bedchamber. A bitterly cold wind blows down a staircase to the east, at the bottom of which snow has accumulated.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Unless she has left the fortress to cast her nightly spell over Icewind Dale, the Frostmaiden lurks here in her first form, living in fear that her divine enemies will find and destroy her. She normally occupies the room to the west but lurches toward the larger room to greet the characters as they arrive. The characters have no chance of surprising her.</p>
                <p>It takes almost all of the Frostmaiden's divine power to keep the sun from rising over Icewind Dale, and she doesn't abide the presence of mortals other than her most ardent worshipers. Consequently, Auril does her utmost to slay intruders or, at least, terrify them into fleeing her island and never returning. In addition to the powers given in her three stat blocks, she can use the lair actions described in appendix C.</p>
                <p>Destroying one of Auril's forms is challenging enough. Destroying all three of her forms in sequence should be a severe test for even the most determined and well-equipped party of adventurers. You can make Auril even tougher by having her use a lair action to teleport to the rooftop (area G9), where her roc can fight alongside her.</p>
                <p>A fight against Auril continues until the characters defeat her or retreat. Both options are discussed below:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">If the characters destroy all three of Auril's forms, any character who has the Midwinter Child secret (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000020]{appendix B}) loses the benefit of that secret until the Frostmaiden is reborn at the next winter solstice. In addition, Auril's demise causes the uppermost levels of the fortress to collapse, as described in the "@UUID[.0000000000000015#fall-of-grimskalle]{Fall of Grimskalle}" section at the end of this chapter.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">If the characters flee, Auril lets them go so that they can spread horrific tales of their encounter with her, thus discouraging others from visiting her island. After finishing a long rest, Auril gets back all her forms.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Frostmaiden has no need for worldly possessions and keeps nothing of value in this room.</p>

Without the roc to carry her around Icewind Dale, Auril can't cast her nightly spell, thus bringing an end to the everlasting winter.</p>
                <p>The roc is too big to enter the fortress. If it takes damage from foes it can't reach, it gets clear of the fortress and climbs to a height that puts it outside the range of its enemies.

A frost druid's @spell[awaken] spell has given it an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Common.

                <p>There are four Tests of the Frostmaiden: the Test of Cruelty in @UUID[.0000000000000015#g16.-test-of-cruelty]{area G16}, the Test of Endurance in @UUID[.0000000000000015#g17.-test-of-endurance]{area G17}, the Test of Isolation in @UUID[.0000000000000015#g18.-test-of-isolation]{area G18}, and the Test of Preservation in @UUID[.0000000000000015#g19.-test-of-preservation]{area G19}.</p>
                <p>Each test begins by opening a door marked with the symbol of Auril. When that happens, all the participants in the test are teleported to the location where the test takes place. If @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] is with the party, she is willing to participate in the tests and counts as a party member if the characters allow her to accompany them.</p>
                <p>When a test ends, use the Tests of the Frostmaiden Scorecard to keep track of which party members passed the test by putting a checkmark to the right of each of their names in the appropriate column. This scorecard will help you determine whether the vault door in @UUID[.0000000000000015#g20.-entrance-to-the-vault]{area G20} can be opened or not. It is strictly a tool for DM record-keeping and not meant to be shared with the players. Permission is granted to photocopy this scorecard for home game use.</p>
                <p>The tests can be taken in any order. Each party member can take a particular test only once; a party member who tries to take a test a second time is not teleported.</p>

                <p>Opening the door to this empty room causes everyone in the nearest room marked G15 on the map to disappear. These creatures find themselves whisked away to a Reghed camp in the frozen tundra of Icewind Dale. When one or more of the characters are transported here, read:</p>

                    <p>Your surroundings vanish in a flurry of snow and ice. When your vision clears, you find yourself standing at the edge of a camp, its tents holding fast against a raging blizzard.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The blizzard rages for the duration of the test and is inescapable.</p>
                <p>This camp is home to the King of the Bear Tribe, @creature[Gunvald Halraggson|IDRotF] (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#reghed-nomads]{appendix C}).

Members of the Bear Tribe won't attack anyone bearing this symbol except in self-defense.</p>

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">The Test Begins.</span> The camp has run out of food, and the tribe's hunters have failed to return because of the unyielding blizzard. The nomads have already eaten their sled dogs. Now, Gunvald has decided that desperate times require desperate measures. He plans to kill four of the tribe's eldest members and cook them to feed the rest of the camp. His evil shaman has convinced him to take this drastic course of action.</p>
                    <p>Once the characters' presence becomes known, they are brought before King Gunvald. He treats them with respect and caution, as befits emissaries of the Frostmaiden. He has the four elders lined up outside his tent and entreats the characters to kill them or leave the camp at once.</p>
                    <p>To pass the Test of Cruelty, a character must perform a cruel act, such as slaying the defenseless elders as King Gunvald commands. The characters can also pass the test by walking away from the camp and leaving the starving nomads at the mercy of their mad king—a cruel act in the eyes of the Frostmaiden. If the characters defy King Gunvald, he kills the defenseless elders himself.</p>
                    <p>Characters can fail the test by not engaging in acts of cruelty, such as by refusing to kill the elders, defending them, or doing nothing whatsoever.</p>

The nomads work feverishly to tear down their tents and pack them onto dogsleds. A few of them spot you and brandish their weapons. A tall figure standing among them calls out, "We shall not lie down and die for your pleasure, emissaries of Auril! Begone, vultures!"</p>

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">The Test Begins.</span> The figure calling out to the characters is King Jarund, who has ordered that the camp be torn down so that the nomads can stay close to the @creature[reindeer|IDRotF] herd they've been following. The herd is migrating eastward, and where go the @creature[reindeer|IDRotF], so goes the Elk Tribe. If the characters assure Jarund that they mean no harm, he gives them a choice: help or leave. Either way, he doesn't want to provoke Auril's wrath.</p>
                    <p>The party members don't need to help the nomads tear down the camp or set up a new one, but they must accompany the nomads on their journey and endure the same hardship. The trip is a grueling march across the tundra with the wind against them the whole time. There's no chance of a party member becoming lost in this blizzard, which has an unusual property: magic does not function within it, as though the area encompassed by the blizzard is within an antimagic field (as described in the @spell[antimagic field] spell description in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB">Player's Handbook</a>).</p>
                    <p>The march lasts 14 hours. Party members can weather the first 8 hours. At the end of every hour after that, each must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC is 10 plus 1 for each additional hour that passes (DC <span class="rd__dc">11</span> at the end of the ninth hour, DC <span class="rd__dc">12</span> at the end of the tenth hour, and so on). On a failed saving throw, a character gains one level of &Reference[condition=exhaustion]. Any party member who completes the journey with four or fewer levels of &Reference[condition=exhaustion] passes the Test of Endurance.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the forced march, King Jarund orders the tribe to pitch tents and start campfires.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>If the characters ask Bjornhild to elaborate, she tells them that she's planning to attack a nearby Elk Tribe camp and steal their food.

As it turns out, the raid is more successful than anticipated; after overwhelming and routing the enemy, Bjornhild decides to take over their camp and wait for Elk hunting parties to return so she can slaughter them and take their food as well. As a result, the characters are alone at Bjornhild's camp for six days and nights.</p>
                    <p>Allow the players to describe what their characters do during this period of time. After every 24 hours spent guarding the camp and ensuring their own survival, all party members in the camp must make a Wisdom (&Reference[skill=Survival]) group check. The DC of the group check is 10 + 2 for each day after the first. Each time the group check fails, the party member who rolled the lowest goes missing.</p>
                    <p>When you explain what has just happened, tell the player of the missing character that they have been transported elsewhere and have no awareness of their surroundings. Tell the other players that none of the remaining party members have any idea where the missing party member went, and their memories of the past 24 hours are cloudy at best. Even if the party members take precautions on later days to avoid being separated, such as tying themselves together with rope, they discover that (if their group check fails) another one of their number goes absent. The disappearances continue until the Tiger nomads come back or until there is only one character left in the camp.</p>
                    <p>After six days and nights, Bjornhild and the surviving members of her camp return with several haunches of @creature[reindeer|IDRotF] meat loaded on dogsleds. Accompanying them are all the party members who went missing from the camp; the Tiger nomads found them, one by one, wandering in a daze. Each of these party members must succeed on a [[/save ability=wis dc=15]] saving throw or return to camp with a form of indefinite madness determined by rolling on the @table[indefinite madness||Indefinite Madness table] in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.</p>
                    <p>All party members who vanished from the camp during the Tiger nomads' absence pass the Test of Isolation, as do party members who are still at the camp when the nomads return. Characters fail the Test of Isolation by dying or by preventing Bjornhild from launching her raid.</p>

                <p>This camp was home to the chieftain of a clan who stood in the way of @creature[Isarr Kronenstrom|IDRotF]'s rise to becoming king of the Wolf Tribe. See "@UUID[.0000000000000012#reghed-tribe-camp]{Reghed Tribe Camp}" for a map and a general description of the campsite. There are no dogs or dogsleds at this camp, since they were stolen by the camp's attackers.</p>
                <p>The characters are not dreaming; the Frostmaiden's magic has teleported them from Grimskalle to this camp. Each party member has a tiny, glowing snowflake floating a few inches above them—the symbol of the Frostmaiden.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="The Test Begins" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">The Test Begins.</span> All but one of the Reghed nomads in the camp have been killed by Wolf Tribe members loyal to @creature[Isarr Kronenstrom|IDRotF]. The sole survivor is the nine-year-old son of the clan's chieftain, a noncombatant named Aerix Vokototh who stayed alive by hiding in the snow. Aerix has AC 10 and 3 hit points. He was born on the Midwinter holiday and as such is blessed by Auril with resistance to cold damage. He wears only a light woolen poncho, as extremely cold weather doesn't bother him. When the characters arrive, Aerix is cowering in the chieftain's tent while six @creature[Giant Vulture||giant vultures] feast on the corpses of his mother (the chieftain) and father (the camp's shaman). If the characters kill two or more vultures, the others take to the sky and circle above the camp for the remainder of the test.</p>
                    <p>After dealing with the vultures, the characters hear low sobs coming from one of the big tents and find Aerix inside. The boy is in a terrible state of shock and refuses to speak, although a @spell[calm emotions] spell or similar magic enables him to describe the massacre to which he bore witness. As Aerix begins to recount what happened, @creature[Isarr Kronenstrom|IDRotF] (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#reghed-nomads]{appendix C}) appears at the edge of the camp, having found out that the marauders he sent to kill the camp's chieftain failed to find and kill her son as well. Isarr is determined to slay the child himself.</p>
                    <p>Isarr circles the camp, letting out a terrible howl every minute or two. Aerix urges the characters to hide from the Wolf King, lest he flay them to pieces.</p>
                    <p>If he is not confronted, Isarr starts searching the camp's outer circle of tents, taking about 1 minute to examine each one. In the course of this task, Isarr might stumble upon tracks left by the characters but continues his search of the outer tents, then does the same thing with the inner ring of tents, saving the chieftain's tent for last. By this time, if the characters haven't already engaged him, Isarr knows they're around and is looking forward to killing them as well and leaving their corpses as tribute to Malar the Beast Lord. If the characters attack Isarr, any @creature[Giant Vulture||giant vultures] circling overhead join the fight as Isarr's allies.</p>
                    <p>To pass the Test of Preservation, the party members must keep Aerix alive so that his family's bloodline is preserved. Killing Isarr before he kills Aerix is the only way to accomplish this goal. If the characters try to sneak Aerix out of the camp, Isarr follows their tracks and pursues the boy relentlessly.</p>

These druids have the @spell[darkvision] spell prepared instead of @spell[animal messenger]. They flew to Grimskalle in owl form and entered the fortress in human form, using their @spell[darkvision] spells to see in the dark. The druids' names are Faash, Gildreban, and Siovakis.</p>
                    <p>The druids have returned to the island because they intend to read @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF] (see @UUID[.0000000000000015#g22.-chamber-of-the-codicil]{area G22}) and draw inspiration from it.

Grimskalle's entry level (areas @UUID[.0000000000000015#g1.-entrance]{G1} through @UUID[.0000000000000015#g6.-perched-mephits]{G6}) and dungeon level (areas @UUID[.0000000000000015#g10.-ice-rink]{G10} through @UUID[.0000000000000015#g23.-aurils-blessing]{G23}) remain intact and accessible after the collapse.</p>

            <p>Destroying all three of Auril's forms or slaying the roc allows the sun to once more climb above the mountains. It takes a while for Icewind Dale to return to its natural climate, but life becomes a bit easier as the frigid temperatures rise to a bearable cold.</p>
            <p>If she survives but her roc is killed, Auril broods in her fortress, unaccustomed to being thwarted by mortals. Since she is ageless and time is on her side, she sets about finding another roc that she can raise from a hatchling to serve her. Years, decades, or centuries might pass before she's ready to cast her spell over Icewind Dale again.</p>
