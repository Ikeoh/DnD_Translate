    <p>After opening a fissure in the Reghed Glacier, a party of explorers prepares to head inside.</p>
    <p>Equipped with the "Rime of the Frostmaiden," the characters can begin their search for the lost Netherese city buried deep in the Reghed Glacier. Ideally, the characters should be at least 8th level when they embark on this journey. Lower-level characters can survive the Caves of Hunger if they're cautious and rest often to regain their spent hit points and magic.</p>
    <p>The characters must use the "Rime of the Frostmaiden" to open a crack in the glacial wall at a place where a waterfall once tumbled down the glacier. The newly formed passage leads to the Caves of Hunger, a dungeon that was sealed off by the Frostmaiden long ago—a network of sepulchral ice caves haunted by ravenous beings. These chambers must be successfully navigated to reach the Netherese city of Ythryn.</p>

        <p>This chapter focuses on the characters' exploration of the ice caves. There's a good chance that @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] is present as well, serving as an NPC guide. If she died earlier in the adventure, the characters can use @item[Professor Skant|IDRotF] as a substitute guide, assuming they retrieved Vellynne's <em>professor orb</em> from Auril's island in @UUID[.0000000000000015#i3.-nass-lantomirs-ghost]{chapter 5}. If neither Vellynne nor Professor Skant are around, you can furnish another NPC with the information needed to reach the Caves of Hunger. Likely candidates include @creature[Hengar Aesnvaard|IDRotF] (see "Elk Tribe Escort" below) and @creature[Dzaan's simulacrum|IDRotF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}).</p>

            <p>With grand events having been set in motion, those sensitive to prophecy have begun to experience dreams and visions.

                    <p>As you crest another ridge, you spot a dozen humanoids approaching, their cloaks flapping in the wind sweeping down from the eastern glacier.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The approaching figures are ten @creature[Tribal Warrior||tribal warriors] of the Elk Tribe, led by @creature[Mjenir|IDRotF] (neutral human @creature[druid] with &Reference[skill=Survival] +4) and @creature[Hengar Aesnvaard|IDRotF] (neutral good human @creature[gladiator] with &Reference[skill=Survival] +5). @creature[Mjenir|IDRotF] waves at the characters to signal his peaceful intentions. If they are willing to speak, he directs them to a rocky alcove where both parties can enjoy a reprieve from the wind.</p>
                <p>@creature[Mjenir|IDRotF] proceeds to explain his vision and warns of grave danger ahead:</p>

                    <p>The Reghed Glacier rises hundreds of feet into the sky. The foot of the glacier is still a half-mile away.</p>

                <p>Characters who have a passive Wisdom (&Reference[skill=Perception]) score of 15 or higher are not @status[surprised] by the ambush, nor are members of the Elk Tribe who are traveling with the party.</p>

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Ambushers.</span> @creature[Mjenir|IDRotF] was not the only one who foresaw the characters' path. The queen of the Tiger Tribe, @creature[Bjornhild Solvigsdottir|IDRotF] (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#queen-bjornhild-solvigsdottir]{appendix C}), has also been stirred to action. Bjornhild worships Auril and is furious that the party has decided to meddle in the Frostmaiden's affairs. If Bjornhild died earlier in the adventure, replace her with a @creature[frost druid|IDRotF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}) named Ajka.</p>
                    <p>If Bjornhild leads the ambush, she is joined by her pet @creature[saber-toothed tiger], Grava. If Ajka leads the ambush, give her a woolly @creature[rhinoceros] companion. Twenty @creature[Tribal Warrior||tribal warriors] make up the rest of the ambushing force. Before closing to melee range, they hurl spears at the characters.</p>

If the characters let the Elk Tribe members fend off the Tigers, the outcome of the battle depends on whether Bjornhild leads the ambush:</p>
                    <ul class="rd__list">
                        <li class="rd__li ">If Bjornhild leads the ambush, both she and Grava survive, as does Hengar. All three are reduced to half their hit points (rounded down). Everyone else is slain. Bjornhild takes Hengar prisoner and interprets the characters' escape as a sign that Auril intends to slay them herself; consequently, Bjornhild doesn't pursue them.</li>
                        <li class="rd__li ">If Ajka leads the ambush, she and Hengar are the sole survivors with half their hit points remaining. After a brief standoff, Ajka polymorphs into a snowy owl and flees, leaving the wounded Hengar alone.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Characters who refuse to let the Elk Tribe fight this battle without them are attacked by Bjornhild and her saber-toothed tiger (or Ajka and her rhinoceros) while Hengar and his fellow Elk Tribe warriors clash with the rest of the attacking force. You can forgo making attack rolls for the tribal warriors; assume that they all act on the same initiative count and that one warrior from each tribe dies each round on that tribe's turn. Hengar kills an additional Tiger Tribe warrior on each of his turns. @creature[Mjenir|IDRotF] stays out of melee and uses his @spell[produce flame] cantrip to hurl fire at enemies.</p>

        <p>When the floating city of Ythryn plummeted from the sky into the Reghed Glacier centuries ago, the impact of the collision (and the resulting heat) drove the city deeper into its heart until, finally, it came to rest. Auril then buried the city under the ice to preserve it, claiming it as her own.</p>
        <p>The Caves of Hunger is a sprawling dungeon complex hollowed out of the Reghed Glacier. Some of its caves and tunnels formed naturally, some formed as a byproduct of Ythryn's fall, and still others are the work of creatures such as remorhazes that can dig or melt their way through solid ice. The fact that the entire complex is made of ice contributes to its alien atmosphere. The air is often stale, sound behaves strangely, and the tension of moving ever downward wears on the sanity of even the boldest adventurers.</p>

The vampire is the only wandering monster that the characters encounter in the Caves of Hunger, and they are likely to encounter it more than once as they descend deeper into the caves.</p>
            <p>@creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF]'s <em>professor orb</em>, @item[Professor Skant|IDRotF], is an expert on vampires and vampirism. Once it becomes aware of Tekeli-li, the <em>professor orb</em> shares the vampire's known weaknesses with the characters.</p>
            <p>The party should meet Tekeli-li several times. The vampire's strategy is to drain the party's resources, then retreat and recover before attacking again. If Tekeli-li ever takes more than 20 damage during an encounter, the vampire turns to mist and withdraws to a safe location in the dungeon. Even when the vampire is not immediately present, its cackling laughter echoes through the caves sporadically.</p>
            <p>You can stage an encounter with Tekeli-li anywhere you like. If you're not sure where it might be or how it should behave, roll a [[/r d6]] and consult the Tekeli-li's Location table. The table determines where the vampire is first encountered. If the vampire withdraws, roll again on the table to determine where it goes (roll again if the result indicates no change in its location).</p>
            <p>If the characters have not encountered the vampire by the time they reach @UUID[.0000000000000016#h36.-frozen-grove]{area H36}, it attacks them there.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Iron golems were used as sentries throughout Ythryn. This head is all that remains of a golem that was decapitated when the city crashed. It has been separated from the city and its body ever since. The potent magic used in the golem's construction has kept the head functional.</p>
                <p>The head can't attack or use its Poison Breath in this state, nor can it speak. It can communicate by blinking the lights in its eyes—one blink for no, two blinks for yes, three blinks for "I don't know." It understands Elvish and Loross (see the "Loross: The Netherese Tongue" sidebar). If the characters know none of these languages, Professor Skant can communicate with the golem in Loross on their behalf.</p>
                <p>Here are examples of the questions the party might ask, and the golem's responses:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">"Do you know where Ythryn is?" (No.)</li>

                    <li class="rd__li ">"Is there danger ahead?" (I don't know.)</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">"Have other creatures passed through this cave recently?" (Yes. The golem is referring to the kobold vampire spawn that lair in the caves to the east.)</li>

                    <p>Loross, a language spoken by the Netherese, is a dead tongue. Very few creatures in the world today would recognize it, much less speak it. Loross used the Draconic alphabet in its written form, while the spoken language had many similarities with Elvish, due to the cultural influence the elves had on Netherese civilization. A character who speaks Elvish can understand what a creature speaking Loross is saying, and vice versa. A character who has the Cloistered Scholar or Sage background, or a warlock who knows the Eyes of the Rune Keeper invocation, can translate written Loross without an ability check.</p>

                    <p>This cavern has a fifteen-foot-high ceiling and a smaller, dead-end cave at the back of it. Sticking out of the larger cave's floor at a sixty-degree angle is a giant-sized wooden spear with its obsidian tip pointing upward. The weapon glows with a faint, cold light.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The spear is 25 feet long, but only its top half is visible; the rest of it is lodged in the icy floor. Pulling it free requires an action and a successful [[/save ability=str dc=23]] (&Reference[skill=Athletics]) check.</p>

The giant was a hunter of white dragons and a Chosen of Thrym, the evil god of frost giants. When Vlagomir died, his warrior's spark was bound to the spear. The first time a barbarian, fighter, monk, or ranger touches the spear, the light around the spear fades as Vlagomir's spark bestows the following supernatural charm on the character (see "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,7,charms,0">Supernatural Gifts</a>" in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>):</p>

Armor and clothing you are wearing and weapons you are carrying magically increase in size to match your growth. If you are the recipient of a @spell[greater restoration] spell or similar magic, this charm vanishes from you, and you immediately shrink back to normal size, along with any armor, clothing, and weapons in your possession.</p>

                    <p>A flat sheet of cloudy ice forms one wall of this forty-foot-high cavern. Something dark and humungous shifts behind the wall, its tentacles waving unimpeded. You become aware you are not alone inside your mind. Somehow, this horror from another world has wormed its way inside you.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Something beyond mortal comprehension exists partially inside the wall of ice and partially within some distant, horrific demiplane. As this otherworldly entity peers into the cavern, visitors risk losing their sanity to its influence.</p>
                <p>Any creature that comes within 20 feet of the wall of ice is targeted by a @spell[dominate monster] spell (save DC <span class="rd__dc">15</span>). The entity can concentrate on up to ten such spells at once. Any creature that successfully saves against the spell resists it and can't be targeted by this effect again. On a failed save, the creature stands perfectly still and does nothing while the alien entity probes its mind for 1 hour. If a creature remains under the spell's effect for the full duration, it must make a [[/save ability=int dc=15]] saving throw at the end of the hour, taking 44 ([[/r 8d10]]) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Whether the save succeeds or fails, a creature subjected to the hour-long probe also gains a randomly determined form of long-term madness, determined by rolling on the @table[long-term madness||Long-Term Madness table] in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.</p>
                <p>The ice wall has AC 13, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. If the wall takes 50 points of damage or more, large cracks form along its surface, and the alien entity withdraws into its distant demiplane, never to return. As it withdraws, its @spell[dominate monster] spells end.</p>

If given the chance, Hathowyn tries to engage the characters in conversation, speaking Elvish or Sylvan. She hopes to keep them in the grove for as long as possible. If the characters try to leave, Hathowyn tries to charm one of them into staying and keeping her company. The dryad knows the following information:</p>

                <p>These four @creature[Nothic||nothics], evil denizens of Ythryn, followed Yilsebek and his fellow drow as far as the dryad's grove (area H36) before taking refuge in this cave. The nothics use their Weird Insight to glean secrets from the characters. They are reluctant to provoke a well-armed group of adventurers, preferring to pick off lone prey, but if attacked, they respond in kind.</p>
                <p>Offering food and drink to the nothics loosens their tongues, but these ones speak and understand only Loross (see the "@UUID[.0000000000000016#loross:-the-netherese-tongue]{Loross: The Netherese Tongue}"). They can also write in the Draconic script. @item[Professor Skant|IDRotF] can serve as a translator if none of the characters can understand the nothics.</p>
                <p>The nothics have no memory of their lost humanity, and any information they might provide is garbled with bits of nonsense. Characters who succeed on a [[/save ability=wis dc=12]] (&Reference[skill=Insight]) check can glean the following information from the nothics after a brief conversation:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">Iriolarthas, a powerful Netherese archwizard, watches over Ythryn. He has lost not only his mind, but most of his body as well. All that remains of him is a floating human skull.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Giant floating hands made of magical force wander around in the city.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Ythryn's <em>mythallar</em> won't function properly as long as the Spindle—a powerful artifact dating back 40,000 years—remains in the city. The artifact is located within the city's central spire.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">One must perform a ritual to enter Ythryn's central spire. (The nothics don't remember how the ritual works, but they do recall that clues can be found in the towers of wizardry scattered throughout the city.)</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Somewhere in Ythryn is a scroll that can summon the tarrasque.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This tunnel of ice cuts through the glacier for almost a mile before ending at the great ice cavern that contains Ythryn, described in @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000017]{chapter 7}.</p>

            <p>Guided by the visions of Levistus, @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] follows the characters to the Reghed Glacier. Around the time when the characters reach Ythryn, the tiefling wizard and her followers arrive at the Caves of Hunger and kill any Elk Tribe warriors guarding the entrance. @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] then leads her troupe through the icy caverns, marching toward her destiny.</p>
            <p>More information about @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] and her followers is provided in the next chapter.</p>
