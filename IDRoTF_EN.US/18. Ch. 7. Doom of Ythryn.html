    <p>Ythryn rests in the silent depths of the Reghed Glacier. Ice encloses the enclave on all sides, yet the magic imbued in its stonework shields it from utter destruction. Ythryn is now a corpse city—a tomb for those who perished here and a death trap for those who dare to explore its ruined, glaciated halls.</p>

            <p>Ideally, the characters are 9th level when they first arrive at Ythryn. You decide how quickly they advance in level. Treat the following as suggestions:</p>
            <ul class="rd__list">
                <li class="rd__li ">The characters gain a level after overcoming the challenges of all eight towers of magic (areas @UUID[.0000000000000017#y4.-tower-of-abjuration]{Y4}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y7.-tower-of-conjuration]{Y7}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y11.-tower-of-divination]{Y11}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y18.-tower-of-necromancy]{Y18}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y20.-tower-of-evocation]{Y20}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y22.-tower-of-illusion]{Y22}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y24.-tower-of-enchantment]{Y24}, and @UUID[.0000000000000017#y26.-tower-of-transmutation]{Y26}).</li>

                <li class="rd__li ">The characters gain a level if they accomplish something extraordinary, such as destroying Iriolarthas the demilich, all three of Auril's forms, or the obelisk in @UUID[.0000000000000017#y21.-obelisk]{area Y21}.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you follow the suggestions above, the characters could be as high as 12th level by the adventure's conclusion—an important consideration if you intend to continue the campaign beyond this adventure.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1191"><span class="entry-title-inner">Iriolarthas the Demilich</span></h2>
            <p>Iriolarthas, once a powerful lich and before that a human wizard of Netheril, exists today as a demilich that haunts the ruins of Ythryn. Iriolarthas endures as a deteriorating skull that drifts about the necropolis in lonely despair. Wispy symbols of the eight schools of magic form above it and quickly dissipate.</p>
            <p>A demilich is what becomes of a lich that neglects to feed souls into its phylactery, and Iriolarthas's phylactery has been empty for nearly two thousand years, buried under the rubble of Ythryn far from the demilich's reach. Having lost its body and its spellcasting abilities, the demilich holds out hope that other Netherese wizards will come to its rescue, unaware that the Empire of Netheril no longer exists. Though it has been trapped in Ythryn under the ice for centuries, the demilich has a very poor sense of how much time has passed.</p>
            <p>When confronted by new arrivals, the demilich assumes they are rescuers from another Netherese enclave and watches to see what they do. The demilich has no means of communication and can't be contacted telepathically, so it judges new arrivals in silence. Characters who observe Iriolarthas and succeed on a [[/save ability=wis dc=13]] (&Reference[skill=Insight]) check can ascertain that the demilich is watching them closely to see how they react to their surroundings. If the demilich concludes, based on its observations, that the characters are not a rescue team from another Netherese enclave, it tries to destroy them before they can steal any of Ythryn's secrets. The same is true of invasive NPCs such as members of the Arcane Brotherhood. A party can fool the demilich into thinking they belong in Ythryn by succeeding on a [[/save ability=cha dc=13]] (&Reference[skill=Deception]) group check. If the group check is successful, Iriolarthas believes the party is what it pretends to be; on a failed group check, the demilich sees through the party's deception and becomes hostile toward the characters. If the demilich thinks that the characters are rescuers, given how they appear and act, it follows them around until something happens to change its mind.</p>
            <p>Although it lacks the means to communicate, the demilich dimly recalls the circumstances that led to its present situation.</p>

        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="The Fall of Ythryn" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1192"><span class="entry-title-inner">The Fall of Ythryn</span></h2>
            <p>After using the @item[Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000022]{appendix D}) to lift the enclave of Ythryn into the sky, Iriolarthas and his apprentices traveled to the frozen north in search of relics of Ostoria, a bygone empire of magic-wielding giants that waged war against the dragons forty thousand years earlier. After many fruitless excavations, they found a large stone spindle bearing strange sigils at the bottom of the Sea of Moving Ice and brought it back to Ythryn for study in the fall of −343 DR, the Year of Chilled Marrow. During one of their experiments, something went wrong—a flash of power from the spindle caused the <em>Ythryn</em> <em>mythallar</em> to shut down, which in turn caused the city to fall out of the sky and crash into the ice below.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of Ythryn had only a few moments to react as the city fell. Iriolarthas conjured a doorway to a magical demiplane and stepped through it just in time. As Ythryn settled into its icy grave, all magic in the city became undone for a brief time, as though something was trying to siphon it all away. The demiplane expelled Iriolarthas in that instant, trapping the lich in Ythryn, and became a living demiplane (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}). Iriolarthas searched the ruins of the city for his spellbook and his phylactery, recovering only the former. He also found several magical servants in stasis that had survived the devastation, as well as a handful of apprentices who had used their spells in ingenious ways to escape death.</p>
            <p>Some of those inside tried to flee Ythryn, but glacial ice blocked all conventional routes of escape, and attempts to leave by magic were thwarted by a troublesome intercessor: the mysterious spindle in Iriolarthas's citadel was still putting out magical pulses of energy to hinder spellcasting. By the time this disruption stopped some fifty years later, fear and madness had warped the minds of the apprentice mages, transforming them into nothics. Meanwhile, Iriolarthas grew increasingly feeble until, finally, the lich's skeletal body turned to dust.</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset" data-roll-name-ancestor="Fate of Netheril">
                <h4 class="entry-title-inner"><span class="rd__h rd__h--2-inset" data-title-index="1193">Fate of Netheril</span></h4>
                <p><span title="Page 232">p232</span></p>
                <p>The Empire of Netheril arose more than five thousand years ago. Those who follow the Dalereckoning calendar would place the date of Netheril's birth at −3859 DR.</p>
                <p>The Netherese legacy began with the discovery of the <em>Nether Scrolls</em>. These long, golden scrolls taught Netherese arcanists how to wield magic beyond their wildest fantasies. It took centuries, but the Netherese who mastered the power of the <em>Nether Scrolls</em> became a ruling class, living on great flying cities or taking refuge in remote, subterranean lairs.</p>
                <p>Despite their great power, the Netherese faced a growing threat. Under the heart of their empire lived spellcasting aberrations called phaerimm. Using their ability to drain magic, the phaerimm began to unravel the Weave, without which Netheril would collapse into ruin. In −339 DR, four years after the fall of Ythryn, the empire's most powerful arcanist, Karsus, attempted to neutralize the phaerimm threat by casting a spell of unparalleled power that would enable him to replace Mystryl as the god of magic, giving him absolute control over the Weave. Mystryl countered Karsus at a key moment during the casting of the spell, a feat she could accomplish only by sacrificing herself and tearing the Weave. Karsus was slain instantly, and for a time thereafter, most of the creatures of the world were either without magic or simply unable to control it.</p>
                <p>Without great magic to keep them aloft, the remaining flying cities of Netheril crashed to the ground, and many arcanists who survived were driven mad. Once magic came back into use, Netherese arcanists could no longer cast their mightiest spells as they had before, forcing them to resort to traditional wizardry. Four hundred years after Karsus cast his spell, the Netherese empire was no more—crushed by its enemies and undone by its own hubris.</p>
                <p>In the Forgotten Realms, Netheril is the definitive lost empire. It rose to unparalleled heights but eventually fell into ruin. If you've ever played a science fiction game that includes the concept of a lost, highly advanced civilization, then you can begin to imagine what ancient Netheril must have been like. Out of this empire came many of the fearsome monsters, bizarre dungeons, and wondrous magic items found in Faerûn today.</p>

            <p>The following magical effects are present throughout the necropolis:</p>

                <li class="rd__li ">Humanoids who remain in the necropolis for too long are likely to contract an arcane blight (see below).</li>

                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1198"><span class="entry-title-inner">Arcane Blight</span></h3>
                <p>Any humanoid that spends 12 hours in the necropolis must succeed on a [[/save ability=con dc=15]] saving throw or contract an arcane blight. This magical disease transforms the humanoid into a @creature[nothic], but only after the victim experiences hallucinations and feelings of isolation and paranoia. Other symptoms include clammy skin, hair loss, and myopia (nearsightedness).</p>
                <p>A player character infected with the arcane blight gains the following flaw: "I don't trust anyone." This flaw, which supersedes any conflicting flaw, is fed by delusions that are difficult for the character to distinguish from reality. Common delusions include the belief that that allies are conspiring to steal the victim's riches or otherwise turn against the victim.</p>
                <p>Whenever it finishes a long rest, an infected humanoid must repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for future saves against the arcane blight drops by [[/r 1d6]]. If the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature overcomes the arcane blight and becomes immune to the effect of further exposure. A creature that fails three of these saving throws transforms into a @creature[nothic] under the DM's control. Only a @spell[wish] spell or divine intervention can undo this transformation.</p>
                <p>A @spell[greater restoration] spell or similar magic ends the infection on the target, removing the flaw and all other symptoms, but this magic doesn't protect the target against further exposure.</p>

For example, an adventurer could light a handful of lamp oil to "summon a flame" (taking 1 fire damage in the process). Any creature that performs all eight steps of the ritual in the correct order outside the spire can pass through the force field thereafter.</p>

                    <p>The illusory figure disappears after making its announcement, and adventurers on the playing field have thirty seconds to round out their team of six.

                        <p>Chain Lightning is a game in which two teams of six players compete against each other. To win, a team must eliminate the other team's players by hitting them with a 3-inch-diameter iron ball. A player struck by the thrown ball is eliminated and teleported to the sidelines. The game ends when all of one team's players have been eliminated.</p>
                        <p>When the game begins, an iron ball magically appears in a random location on the arena floor roughly equidistant from the two teams. The ball is a simple ranged weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. Its range is 120 feet, and it deals [[/r 1d4]] bludgeoning damage on a hit.</p>
                        <p>To simulate a game of Chain Lightning, follow these steps:</p>

                            <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Step 1.</span> Every player makes a Dexterity (&Reference[skill=Athletics]) check. The individual with the highest roll gets the ball, and that person's team is on offense. Resolve a tie with a Strength (&Reference[skill=Athletics]) contest.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Step 2" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                            <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Step 2.</span> To simulate the ball being passed around, every player makes a [[/save ability=dex dc=15]] (&Reference[skill=Athletics]) check. If the team on offense gets more successes than the team on defense, one player on offense can try either to hurl the ball between the metal tines of an electrified mast, hoping to impart an electrical charge to the ball, or make a ranged weapon attack with the ball against a player on defense. Each option is described below:</p>
                            <ul class="rd__list">
                                <li class="rd__li ">Hurling the ball between the tines of an electrified mast requires a successful ranged attack roll against AC 15. If this attack hits, the ball becomes electrically charged as it passes between the tines. Repeat step 1 to determine which team gets custody of the electrically charged ball.</li>
                                <li class="rd__li ">If the ball is thrown at a player on defense and it hits, the player struck by the ball is eliminated. If the ball is electrically charged when it hits, it deals an additional 3 ([[/r 1d6]]) lightning damage to the eliminated player, and an arc of lightning shoots from the ball and automatically hits another randomly determined player on the same team. This second player takes 3 ([[/r 1d6]]) lightning damage and is also eliminated. If the ball is thrown at a player and it misses, it loses its electrical charge if it has one. Repeat step 1 to determine which team gets custody of the ball.</li>

A character who searches the outside of the tower for traps finds and identifies the glyph with a successful [[/save ability=int dc=18]] (&Reference[skill=Arcana]) check. The glyph triggers when a creature steps through the tower's entrance and resets after 24 hours.</p>
                <p>Once inside, the characters can ascend to the top of the tower. When they arrive there, read:</p>

                    <p>A huge anvil chiseled with vivid blue runes rests in the center of a thirty-foot-diameter, thirty-foot high circular chamber. Resting atop it is a hammer adorned with matching runes.</p>
                    <p>Six armored figures stand guard around the anvil. At the rear of the chamber, the frozen corpse of a wizard lies in a pile of rubble. Blue flames flicker from braziers spaced around the room, illuminating a carved inscription on the ceiling.</p>

                <p>Six @creature[demos magen|IDRotF] (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#magen]{appendix C}) guard the anvil, which has the power to destroy other magic items. The anvil was a source of vexation for Ythryn's tomb tappers, which believe magic items to be sacred. When Ythryn collapsed, the protective wards surrounding the tower unraveled, and one of the tomb tappers seized the opportunity to kill the anvil's creator, High Abjurer Taruth. The wizard's mauled body lies in this chamber, the stony floor next to him broken where the tomb tapper forced its way into the room. The magen won't let anyone use the anvil and fight to defend it.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Anvil of Disjunction" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Anvil of Disjunction.</span> The anvil has the power to destroy any magic item that isn't an artifact. When a character holds the anvil's hammer for the first time, a voice inside their head, seeming to come from the anvil, says, "Bring me your items of power, and together we shall destroy them." To destroy an item, the character must place it on the anvil and strike it three times with the hammer. Each hammer strike takes one action. On the third strike, the item disintegrates in a flash of blue light. Every time a character uses the anvil, there is a [[/r 1d100]]{25 percent} chance that a @creature[tomb tapper|IDRotF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}) burrows its way into the tower to attack them (this happens only once).

                    <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                        <p>Peering through the gap in a collapsed wall, you see a fifteen-foot-square infirmary in disarray, with an operating table in the middle of the room. Leather straps extend from one side of the table, into the air above its surface, and fasten to the other side. The shape suggests that something or someone &Reference[condition=invisible] is lashed to the table.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Strapped to the table is a @creature[doppelganger] named Xerophon. It has been rendered &Reference[condition=invisible] and placed in a state of suspended animation by a @spell[sequester] spell. The spell can be dispelled (DC <span class="rd__dc">17</span>), which renders Xerophon visible and awake. The doppelganger looks like a thin, middle-aged man with a sallow complexion, one blue eye and one green eye, and a streak of silver in his long, jet-black hair. The awake doppelganger can use its action to try to slip free of the table's leather straps, doing so with a successful [[/save ability=dex dc=20]] check, or a character can use an action to loosen the straps enough for Xerophon to get free.</p>
                    <p>Shortly before the fall of Ythryn, Xerophon murdered a Netherese sage in the city, stole his identity, and tried to infiltrate the Spire of Iriolarthas. The doppelganger was caught and imprisoned. The prison warden, a Netherese wizard, was interested in studying the doppelganger and perhaps developing a potion that emulated its shapeshifting ability. The wizard made Xerophon acquiesce to a series of experiments, and in between cast @spell[sequester] spells on the doppelganger as a precaution to keep it from escaping.</p>
                    <p>If questioned, Xerophon speaks Loross but switches to Common if no one in the party understands the dead Netherese tongue. The doppelganger plays the part of a low-born Netherese manservant who was sent to the prison by his master, Iriolarthas, for disobedience. Without going into much detail, Xerophon alludes to horrible magical experiments performed on prisoners by the wizard who ran the prison, saying, "I was afraid I might be next."</p>
                    <p>Once it realizes the fate that has befallen Ythryn, Xerophon offers to help the characters search the rest of the city, allowing the doppelganger time to use its Read Thoughts ability to glean all the information it can from the characters' minds. After all, it has a lot of catching up to do. The doppelganger has no ill intentions toward the characters but places self-preservation above all else.</p>
                    <p>If the characters befriend Xerophon, they learn three facts from the @UUID[.0000000000000017#ythryn-lore]{Ythryn Lore table}, which Xerophon shares to build trust. The doppelganger also knows that to bypass the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas, one must perform the eight steps of the Rite of the Arcane Octad outside the spire. The steps of the ritual are hidden inside towers dedicated to the eight arcane schools of magic. Xerophon knows the layout of the city and can lead the party to each of these towers (areas @UUID[.0000000000000017#y4.-tower-of-abjuration]{Y4}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y7.-tower-of-conjuration]{Y7}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y11.-tower-of-divination]{Y11}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y18.-tower-of-necromancy]{Y18}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y20.-tower-of-evocation]{Y20}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y22.-tower-of-illusion]{Y22}, @UUID[.0000000000000017#y24.-tower-of-enchantment]{Y24}, and @UUID[.0000000000000017#y26.-tower-of-transmutation]{Y26}).</p>

                <p>A @spell[detect magic] spell cast here reveals an aura of conjuration magic.

                    <p>If a character steps through the doorway, the fabric of reality warps and bends around them as they arrive in the demiplane: a cluttered den 40 feet long and 20 feet wide. Occupying this extradimensional den are three @creature[Night Hag||night hags] named Auntie Pinch, Auntie Pillage, and Auntie Plunder. This coven frequently leaves its den to roam the Ethereal Plane in search of treasure chests tucked away using the @spell[Leomund's secret chest] spell; however, all three hags are home when the characters arrive.</p>
                    <p>In addition to their innate spellcasting abilities, the hags have the Shared Spellcasting ability of a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#MM">Monster Manual</a>). The hags are prepared to let the characters leave alive in return for a simple price: a single memory plucked from each character's mind.

                    <p>Eight tusk-like towers are embedded in the walls of this monumental building, their spires arching over its shattered roof.</p>
                </div>
                <p>This grand academy was a place of study for novice mages, where each one learned which schools of magic would become their life's work. The place is easily entered through any of the gaping holes in its outer walls. Nothing can be salvaged from the study halls and the towers, but the auditorium holds something of interest:</p>
                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                    <p>Eight stained glass windows overlook a ruined auditorium. Benches glistening with frost are arrayed in broken rows, facing a raised lectern. A bejeweled goblet rests on the lectern. Steam rises from the goblet's contents and dissipates in the cold air.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Each window in the auditorium depicts a wizard casting a spell from one of the eight schools of magic. The spells depicted are @spell[blade ward] (abjuration), @spell[mage hand] (conjuration), @spell[true strike] (divination), @spell[friends] (enchantment), @spell[dancing lights] (evocation), @spell[minor illusion] (illusion), @spell[chill touch] (necromancy), and @spell[prestidigitation] (transmutation), all of which a character can determine with a single successful [[/save ability=int dc=10]] (&Reference[skill=Arcana]) check.</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Magic Goblet" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Magic Goblet.</span> The goblet is embedded with eight colored crystals that represent the eight schools of magic. The liquid inside it looks and tastes like hot water. A @spell[detect magic] spell reveals an aura of divination magic on the goblet and indicates that the liquid carries auras of all eight schools of magic. The liquid isn't poisonous or harmful, and it never runs dry as long as the goblet remains in the auditorium.</p>
                    <p>A humanoid that drinks from the goblet gains a supernatural charm (see "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,7,supernatural%20gifts,0">Supernatural Gifts</a>" in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>). Roll a [[/r d8]] and consult the Magic Goblet Charms table to determine which charm is bestowed. Each charm grants its recipient the power to cast a particular spell, for which Intelligence is the spellcasting ability. The recipient becomes aware of this power as soon as the charm is bestowed. Each charm also has a secret magical effect that triggers when the charm's benefit expires; do not reveal this secret to a player before the effect occurs.</p>
                    <p>Once a creature has gained a charm from the goblet, it cannot gain another one by drinking from the goblet again.</p>

An eyeless, white, 5-foot-tall penguin in a leather harness shuffles behind it, dragging a small cart laden with books. The jackal-headed figure lets out a joyful gasp when it sees the characters and says, "Ah, you must be the librarians! Scrivenscry has need of your assistance." The penguin shifts uneasily as its master speaks.</p>
                    <p>Scrivenscry is an @creature[arcanaloth] who always refers to itself in the third person. It has a fondness for black licorice, strips of which it keeps in the pockets of its robe. The fiend is attended by @creature[Kingsport|IDRotF], a blind, albino giant penguin under the effect of an @spell[awaken] spell.</p>
                    <p>Scrivenscry insists that the characters help it search for the <em>Books of Keeping</em> (see the "Scrivenscry and @creature[Kingsport|IDRotF]" sidebar). If the characters engage Scrivenscry in conversation, @creature[Kingsport|IDRotF] chooses a moment to approach the nearest character and pass a note to them. Scratched into a piece of leather are the words "Help me" in Common, which @creature[Kingsport|IDRotF] wrote using his beak.</p>
                    <p>The characters must evade, defeat, or strike a deal with Scrivenscry if they want to rescue the penguin. If outmatched in combat, Scrivenscry teleports into the depths of the library and plots its revenge. Characters who agree to cooperate with the arcanaloth soon find themselves alone with @creature[Kingsport|IDRotF], who reveals that Scrivenscry is a cruel and wicked master. Neither @creature[Kingsport|IDRotF] nor his master knows much about Ythryn, since they arrived only yesterday by using a @item[spell scroll] of @spell[plane shift].</p>

The fiend stumbled on Ythryn's library by chance and is convinced that at least one of the legendary tomes is hidden here. Alas, Scrivenscry is mistaken.</p>
                        <p>Scrivenscry's anxious penguin servant, @creature[Kingsport|IDRotF], was promised a life of enlightenment. The truth is that @creature[Kingsport|IDRotF] was turned into Scrivenscry's lackey, who lives in fear of his cruel, unpredictable master.

                <p>The grove is nestled in a hollow in the city floor. Vents spaced around its perimeter wall emit puffy gray vapor, which rises above the treetops and disperses as rain.

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Nether Oak.</span> A tree called the Nether Oak grows at the heart of the arboretum. For centuries, Netherese mages crafted their wands and staffs from the wood of this oak. Saturated in profane magic, the tree developed a brooding sentience and a gnarly face. The Nether Oak uses the @creature[treant] stat block but is neutral evil and speaks Common and Primordial.</p>
                    <p>When the characters arrive, the Nether Oak is in deep slumber. To complete the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "@UUID[.0000000000000017#rite-of-the-arcane-octad]{Rite of the Arcane Octad}"), they must craft a wand from the wood of this tree. Gathering wood without waking the tree requires a successful [[/save ability=dex dc=20]] (&Reference[skill=Stealth]) check. If the characters wake the tree, they can convince it to part with some of its wood with a successful [[/save ability=cha dc=15]] (&Reference[skill=Persuasion]) check, but only if it believes they intend to perform nefarious magic with it. The Nether Oak is easily angered and uproots itself if driven to combat. When it attacks, four @creature[Needle Blight||needle blights] spring from the ground to assist it, acting on the same initiative count.</p>

To use the orb, one must place one's hands on it and speak the name of an object or a person. If the target exists on the same plane of existence as the orb, the character touching the orb experiences a vivid vision of the target's location and knows how far away it is and in what direction. Such insight, however, comes with a risk: a creature that receives a vision must make a [[/save ability=con dc=20]] saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) piercing damage as one of its eyes is magically plucked from its socket and teleported inside the orb (see "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,9,injuries,0">Injuries</a>" in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a> for rules on losing an eye).</p>

The orb is magically anchored to this chamber and cannot be removed or destroyed. The only limit to how many times it can be used is how many eyeballs the party has remaining.</p>

                <p>The stone well is 100 feet deep and lined with slippery ice and frost, making it impossible to negotiate without climbing gear or magic. Months before Ythryn's fall, a circle of mages known as the @creature[Telepathic Pentacle|IDRotF] tried to fuse their minds together to become a conjoined telepathic force. The procedure went terribly wrong, and their bodies and minds melded into a single monstrosity. Iriolarthas imprisoned the thing in this empty well so that its latent telepathic powers could be tapped by the city's elite. A short obituary is engraved around the lip of the well in Draconic: "Herein lie the immortal remains of the @creature[Telepathic Pentacle|IDRotF]. Sit, meditate, and learn."</p>

                </div>
                <p>This market hall once sold relics of arcane wonder. Now, its interior is a warren of mangled shop fronts crushed by chunks of ice and stone. Most of the wares have become worthless, and everything else has been destroyed by a headless @creature[iron golem] that is presently rampaging around inside the building.</p>
                <p>Without its head, the golem has the following changes to its statistics:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">The golem has 150 hit points (its hit point maximum). It has a challenge rating of 10 (5,900 XP).</li>

                <p>The golem was decapitated when Ythryn crashed into the Reghed Glacier.

                <p>Six @creature[demos magen|IDRotF] (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#magen]{appendix C}) guard the entrance to this store. They attack anyone who tries to steal the silks on display (see "Treasure" below) but otherwise let strangers explore the store.</p>
                <p>Inside the store, five @creature[galvan magen|IDRotF] (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#magen]{appendix C}) watch over rest of the merchandise. More of the magic silk hangs in long drapes throughout the interior, after being spun by four @creature[Phase Spider||phase spiders] that lurk in the hall's rafters. The spiders are enchanted to produce sorcery silk, a material with illusions woven into it that was fashioned into robes for Ythryn's elite. Characters who enter the store spot the spiders immediately. The spiders defend themselves if attacked but are otherwise nonthreatening.</p>
                <p>In the center of the interior, crystal mannequins draped in finery encircle an empty pedestal. If a creature steps onto the pedestal, an illusion of a magnificently dressed human flickers to life before them and introduces itself as Silksmith Mixyll. The illusion welcomes the guest to its emporium and explains the robe-making process. As it speaks, the phase spiders descend silently and use their legs to take the creature's measurements before spinning the creature a tailor-made robe. As the robe is being fashioned, Mixyll urges its guest to "imagine any image your heart desires." The spiders can, in the 10 minutes it takes to create the robe, spin any illusory design or effect into the garment. On completion, they drape the robe over the creature's shoulders and ascend back to their lair. Each guest can gain this benefit only once.</p>

                <p>Three @creature[galvan magen|IDRotF], three @creature[demos magen|IDRotF], and one @creature[hypnos magen|IDRotF] stand guard outside the observatory with orders to prevent strangers from entering it (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#magen]{appendix C} for their stat blocks). The hypnos magen telepathically orders intruders to leave the area. Defying this order prompts the magen to attack.</p>
                <p>The iron door at the base of the observatory is welded shut from the outside and must be broken down. It has AC 19, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A @creature[blue slaad] lurks on the other side of the doorway and attacks as soon as the door ceases to be an obstacle. This slaad is hostile toward all other creatures and can't be reasoned with.</p>
                <p>Once inside, the characters can ascend the tower to its uppermost floor:</p>

                    <p>A large telescope dominates a thirty-foot-diameter circular chamber at the top of the tower. Gazing into the telescope's eyepiece is a hulking, frog-like biped in wizard's robes that pays you no mind as it mumbles to itself.</p>
                    <p>Adamantine shields cover the observatory's windows. A large chunk of stone from another building has crashed through the roof and embedded itself in the floor like a jagged stone knife. This intruding fragment bears a strange inscription on one side.</p>
                </div>
                <p>By training the magic telescope on distant stars, Ythryn's astronomers could summon alien creatures from those stars to be questioned, studied, or dissected. The fall of Ythryn damaged the telescope beyond repair, rendering it useless.</p>
                <p>When Ythryn fell, a piece of the Tower of Divination (@UUID[.0000000000000017#y11.-tower-of-divination]{area Y11}) crashed through the observatory roof (see "Inscription" below). In the resulting chaos, the blue slaad encountered on the tower's ground floor escaped from its cell and rampaged through the observatory. The Arch-Astronomer, who became infected by the slaad's chaos phage, ordered her surviving apprentices to seal her inside the tower with the monster. In the years, decades, and centuries since, she has managed to keep the blue slaad from escaping through the hole in the roof.</p>
                <p>The Arch-Astronomer, now a @creature[green slaad], is madly fiddling with the telescope, hoping to reverse its power so that it can project itself out of the tower to some faraway place where it can find happiness, but it has no hope of success. If the characters interrupt the Arch-Astronomer, it tries to frighten them away by baring its teeth and claws. If they touch the telescope or damage it further, the slaad goes crazy and attacks them. If they merely want to read the inscription on the wall fragment that crashed through the roof, the slaad leaves them alone.</p>

A character who spends at least 1 minute examining the device can make a [[/save ability=int dc=15]] (&Reference[skill=Arcana]) check. On a successful check, the character gains an understanding of how to use it without knowing its purpose. To operate the device, 80 hit points of blood must be distributed evenly between its eight containers. Once the blood is properly deposited, pulling a lever causes the wheel to spin. The blood disappears 1 minute later, the wheel stops, and a creature crawls out of one of the containers. This creature is loyal to whoever pulled the lever. Determine the creature by rolling a [[/r d6]] and consulting the Chimeric Creations table.</p>

In a leather-bound folder in one of the desk drawers are five scripts for a play called <em>A Blasphemy of Kings</em>.

Each of the five scripts is cursed. Anyone who spends an hour reading a script must succeed on a [[/save ability=wis dc=18]] saving throw or become cursed.

                <p>A @spell[detect magic] spell cast here reveals an aura of necromantic magic. Two hundred @creature[Crawling Claw||crawling claws] are tirelessly but ineffectively trying to excavate the tower's ruins, brick by brick. Anyone who disrupts this effort is attacked by [[/r 2d6]] claws. Deep under the rubble, the corpse of High Necromancer Cadavix lies crushed, yet his @creature[ghost] remains behind to haunt the tower. Characters who linger in the area of the tower witness his gaunt spirit staring glumly down at the debris. Cadavix's ghost is harmless and attacks only in self-defense; it laments the fall of Ythryn and longs to see its corpse freed from the ruins.</p>
                <p>Excavating the tower requires pickaxes and shovels, and it takes a number of hours equal to 50 divided by the number of excavators (minimum 1 hour). The crawling claws don't count as diggers, nor do they attack characters who join the digging effort. Quite the contrary: they get visibly excited as the unearthing of their master draws near. If Cadavix's frozen corpse is unearthed, his spirit is laid to rest and the claws scuttle off into the ruins. Those who find the corpse can claim its necklace (see "Treasure" below).</p>

            <p>A shimmering force field surrounds this 1,200-foot-tall obsidian citadel, which rises from the center of Ythryn and dwarfs all neighboring structures.

            <p><strong>Demilich's Lair</strong>. The spire is the lair of the @creature[demilich] Iriolarthas.

                <p>This ritual room is designed to serve a grisly purpose: the transformation of a living creature into a brain in a jar. Veneranda, a neutral evil Netherese wizard, extracted her own brain to become a @creature[brain in a jar|VRGR] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}) that is affixed to the body of a headless @creature[helmed horror]. If the characters threaten or attack her, Veneranda turns the helmed horror against the group and attacks. Even though they are conjoined, the brain in a jar and the helmed horror roll initiative separately and attack as separate creatures. The brain can detach from the helmed horror as a bonus action.</p>
                <p>Unlike her companions in the ballroom (@UUID[.0000000000000017#y19b.-ballroom]{area Y19b}), Veneranda is coldly calculating and fully aware of Ythryn's fate. If the characters communicate with her, she greets them warily in Loross (see the "@UUID[.0000000000000016#loross:-the-netherese-tongue]{Loross: The Netherese Tongue}" sidebar) and tries to find out what has happened in the world in the centuries since Ythryn's fall. Her singular goal is to restore Ythryn to its past glory. She doesn't know why the city crashed, but she believes that the broken obelisk (see @UUID[.0000000000000017#y21.-obelisk]{area Y21}) can turn back time to repair the damage. To activate its magic, Veneranda says she needs Iriolarthas's @item[staff of power], which he keeps in his study.

If the characters are unwilling to help Veneranda achieve her goal, they quickly outlive their usefulness, and she tries to destroy them.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Soon after the characters enter this area, an entity called Everlast makes its presence known. Everlast is a living spell bound to the spire. It can manifest in the image of any humanoid species or gender but defaults to the form described below:</p>

                    <p>Suddenly, the crystals brighten as rays of energy burst forth one by one to converge in the center of the room.

                </div>
                <p>Everlast speaks the same language as any creature that converses with it. He can't attack or be damaged, and he can't be dispelled.</p>
                <p>Iriolarthas created Everlast to aid him and his apprentices in their doomed mission to restore Ythryn from ruin. In the years since its creation, Everlast has seen Iriolarthas crumble into dust and his apprentices transform into nothics. With nothing to do except uphold his standing orders, Everlast has become hopelessly bored. The characters are the first new faces he has seen for centuries, and he immediately warms to them. Everlast's standing orders are as follows:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">Assist in the city's restoration.</li>
                    <li class="rd__li ">Do not reveal the city's secrets to outsiders.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Everlast can manifest anywhere inside the spire and can move instantaneously between locations within it. If the characters express interest in restoring Ythryn to its former glory, he laments, "Many powerful minds have tried." If the characters mention Veneranda's plan to use Iriolarthas's @item[staff of power] and the obelisk, Everlast cautions them by saying, "That might be unwise, for the obelisk was damaged in the crash. Iriolarthas was unable to repair it." If the characters ask Everlast how to reach Iriolarthas's study, he says he can't help them, saying, "My orders prevent me from revealing the city's secrets to outsiders."</p>

A ten-foot-radius dome of translucent ice encloses the area around the shaft from which you emerge. At the far end of the hall, two blade-shaped patches of pitch darkness hover in the air to either side of a double door. A glowing green crystal roughly the size of a human fist is set into the arch above the doorway.</p>

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Star Field.</span> The swirling star field represents the cosmos as it was known to the Netherese. A character who studies the star field sees a strange phenomenon: a dark star in a position where no known star exists today. This character now risks being cursed with a foreboding sense of doom. At the end of the character's next long rest, the character must make a [[/save ability=int dc=20]] saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains the following flaw: "I can't look at the sky because the ebon star might be looking back at me." Any magic that ends a curse can rid the character of this flaw.</p>

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Wizards' Chairs.</span> Any character who succeeds on a [[/save ability=int dc=10]] (&Reference[skill=Arcana]) check recognizes that the symbols on the chairs represent the eight schools of magic.</p>
                    <p>Anyone who has a supernatural charm gained by drinking from the goblet in area Y8 can sit safely in the chair for the school of magic tied to that charm. Similarly, a wizard can sit in whichever chair matches their chosen arcane tradition. (For example, if @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] is with the party, she can sit in the chair marked with the symbol of necromancy, since she is a necromancer.) If one or more party members take their proper seats here, the star field transforms into a glowing door that persists for 1 minute before transforming back into its original form. While in this room, Iriolarthas the demilich can use an action to cause the doorway to open without having to sit in a chair. Creatures that move through this door are teleported to the upper level of @UUID[.0000000000000017#y19q.-iriolarthass-study]{area Y19q}.</p>
                    <p>Each chair is a Medium object with AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to all damage except force damage. Destroying all the chairs causes the star field to disappear, cutting off access to area Y19q from this room.</p>

                    <p>A ten-foot-tall spindle of gray stone hovers upright and rotates slowly inside this circular chamber. All around it, the surfaces of the room's walls are cracked, as though some terrible energy once coursed through them.</p>
                </div>
                <p>This chamber was built to house unstable magic items during experimentation, but it couldn't contain the artifact that Iriolarthas and his apprentices retrieved from the bottom of the Sea of Moving Ice. During a routine examination, the spindle briefly became active, dispelled magical effects throughout Ythryn, and caused the city to plunge into the Reghed Glacier. The spindle is now dormant but can be reactivated to wreak havoc on the Weave.</p>
                <p>The spindle is immune to all damage and is unaffected by any magic in existence today. It can't be moved from this location. If it is targeted by a spell of 5th level or higher, an explosion of magical energy blasts from it: all magic items and magical effects within a three-mile radius (including those within the spire) are suppressed for 24 hours, and spellcasters are drained of any unexpended spell slots. Living spells, constructs, and other magically created creatures are unaffected. The pulse of energy suppresses magical traps throughout the city and causes the floating chamber above Skydock Spire (@UUID[.0000000000000017#y28.-skydock-spire]{area Y28}) to crash into to the ground, pulverizing it and dealing 99 ([[/r 18d10]]) bludgeoning damage to each creature inside it.</p>

                <p>This room can be accessed by activating the magic door in @UUID[.0000000000000017#y19m.-chamber-of-the-ebon-star]{area Y19m}. The door is a two-way portal that snaps shut after 1 minute, though it can be reopened from this side by speaking the proper command word ("Saldrinar"). Anyone who arrives by this route appears on the room's upper level, which the following boxed text assumes:</p>

                    <p>This large chamber has lain undisturbed for centuries. On the upper level, all around you, are tables covered with wizardly paraphernalia. A soft groaning sound emanates from a shadowy, door-sized rectangle along the curved northern wall.</p>
                    <p>Staircases to the east and west descend to the lower part of the room, where a sunken library is situated in a twenty-foot-wide, ten-foot-deep circular pit. A ladder running along a circular track inside this hole allows easy access to the many books and scrolls on its shelves.</p>

                    <p>Perched on the edge of the pit are three aberrant creatures, each one staring at you with a singular, hideous eye. Floating above the middle of the pit is a human skull with wispy, arcane symbols forming above it.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Have the players roll initiative for their characters, and roll initiative for all the other creatures present.</p>
                <p>See the "Iriolarthas the Demilich" section at the start of the chapter for information about the demilich. Iriolarthas attacks anyone who takes its @item[staff of power] or spellbook from atop the tables (see "Treasure" below). The nothics defend the demilich and themselves.</p>
                <p>The shadowy, groaning rectangle on the north wall is a @creature[living demiplane|IDRotF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}) that was created when Iriolarthas escaped Ythryn's fall. It moves toward the nearest intruder with the intent of trapping that creature into its extradimensional chamber. Anyone who is cast into this chamber must deal with five hostile creatures already trapped inside it: three @creature[galvan magen|IDRotF] (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#magen]{appendix C}) and two @creature[Flesh Golem||flesh golems]. As the golems attack new arrivals, the magen use their Shocking Touch and Static Discharge actions to heal the golems' wounds.</p>
                <p>The sunken library in the middle of the study has shelves lining its 10-foot-high walls and a ladder that can be pushed along a circular track to reach every shelf. Among the books and scrolls kept here is a bundle of parchment maps and schematics detailing aspects of Ythryn. Characters who study these papers for at least 1 hour learn the following facts:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">

                    <li class="rd__li ">If disaster ever struck the city, the wizards could exploit the power of the obelisk (@UUID[.0000000000000017#y21.-obelisk]{area Y21}) to turn back time and avert ruin. The schematics contain instructions for activating the obelisk, which requires a @item[staff of power] as a power source.</li>

                    <li class="rd__li ">The command word to deactivate the force field around the spire is "Olostin." If this name is spoken aloud within Iriolarthas's study, the force field surrounding the spire and the @item[Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF] (@UUID[.0000000000000017#y23.-ythryn-mythallar]{area Y23}) deactivates permanently.</li>

                    <p>@item[Professor Skant|IDRotF] is excited by the discovery of the @item[scroll of tarrasque summoning|IDRotF], since the @creature[tarrasque] is one of its areas of expertise.

                <p>Before Ythryn crashed, Iriolarthas relied on this obelisk as a precautionary measure in case Ythryn experienced a catastrophe. It was one of a few rare Netherese artifacts that could rewind time (see the "Secret of the Obelisks" sidebar).

                        <p>In this adventure, we learn the secret of the obelisks that have appeared in other fifth edition adventures published by Wizards of the Coast, including <a href="https://5e.tools/adventure.html#ToA">Tomb of Annihilation</a> and <a href="https://5e.tools/adventure.html#WDMM">Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage</a>.</p>
                        <p>The first group of these magical obelisks was crafted by a secret society of spellcasters called the Weavers. These obelisks could alter reality on a grand scale, sending a region or an entire world back to an earlier time (effectively erasing part of history). The obelisks were constructed to counteract the effects of calamitous spells and cataclysmic events.</p>
                        <p>An evil wizard named Vecna stole one such obelisk and used it to erase the obelisk's creators from existence. Vecna also stole the knowledge needed to create new ones. That knowledge later came into the possession of Netherese wizards, who built similar obelisks of their own. They believed that if some catastrophe destroyed their empire, these obelisks could help restore it. Unfortunately for them, most of the obelisks built to protect Netheril were stolen or otherwise lost over time, as were records of their purpose and information about how to activate them.</p>

                    <p>An obsidian tower shrouded in gossamer mist soars before you. Eyes carved into the stonework appear to fixate on you as you approach the entrance. The spire's highest window emits a purple light.</p>

                <p>A @spell[detect magic] spell cast here reveals an aura of illusion magic. This magic makes the eyes carved into the tower appear to follow those who approach the structure. Characters who enter the tower find the mist inside as well. Haunting sounds fill the air: heartbeats, sobbing, and ragged, gasping breaths.</p>
                <p>As the party advances, the mists around the characters manifest into illusions of their worst fears, and each character becomes the target of a @spell[phantasmal killer] spell cast at 8th level (save DC <span class="rd__dc">17</span>).

An inscription written on the walls in Draconic reads "Sixth, show thy face to the sky." This is illusory script masquerading as a passage from the Rite of the Arcane Octad (see "@UUID[.0000000000000017#rite-of-the-arcane-octad]{Rite of the Arcane Octad}"). If the characters leave after acquiring only this information, they hear the faint laughter of Ythryn's High Illusionist, Ajamar, trailing behind them as they exit the tower. The real passage is revealed when the illusory script is successfully dispelled (DC <span class="rd__dc">17</span>) or examined by someone who has &Reference[rule=truesight]. It reads "Sixth, hide thyself behind a mask."</p>

                    <p>Ice has engulfed the lower floors of this crumbling tower. Pink light pours out of the highest window—a single point of illumination in a dark and out-of-the-way region of the city.</p>
                </div>
                <p>A @spell[detect magic] spell cast here reveals an aura of enchantment magic. The interior walls are covered with the following sentence in Draconic crudely written with pitch over and over: "All work and no play make Ivira a dull girl." The floor is strewn with pitch-covered buckets and mops frozen stiff by the cold.</p>
                <p>As the party explores higher up in the tower, the recurring phrase changes to: "I am Ivira. Ivira is my name." These words are written in wine stains, and the floor is littered with empty wine bottles.</p>
                <p>Painted in blood above the door leading to the uppermost chamber are the words "The crown knows all!" in Draconic. When the characters enter the topmost chamber, read:</p>
                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                    <p>An elderly woman sits rigidly on a black throne, shrouded in ice. She wears a crown of entwined iron tentacles, and her forehead is bruised where the band fits tightly against her skull. An inscription decorates the wall behind her.</p>
                </div>
                <p>This chamber is lit by pink @spell[continual flame] spells flickering in sconces.</p>
                <p>At the height of her power, the archmage Ivira wore a magic crown to shield her mind against mental attacks. When Ythryn crashed and magic was momentarily undone, Ivira's crown became corrupted and began to siphon away her memories. She has endured centuries as a husk of her former self, kept alive by the magic of her crown. In her current state, she is &Reference[condition=stunned].</p>
                <p>A character who succeeds on a [[/save ability=wis dc=12]] (&Reference[skill=Medicine]) check can tell that Ivira is still alive. Her crown is cursed (see below). Removing it from her head causes Ivira to shudder and shed the ice that has formed around her. With the crown gone, her body rapidly deteriorates, as the centuries take their toll. Ivira has only a few seconds before she dies and turns to dust; with her dying breath, she implores the characters in Loross (the dead Netherese tongue) to "destroy the crown... release my memories... let me have peace."</p>
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Cursed Crown" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Cursed Crown.</span> Ivira can't remove the crown from her head. Any other creature that touches it must succeed on a [[/save ability=wis dc=17]] saving throw or become &Reference[condition=charmed] by it and use its next action to don the crown. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is immune to this effect of the crown for the next 24 hours.</p>
                    <p>From the moment it is donned, the crown begins to siphon memories from its wearer, starting with its earliest memories. The wearer can sense that its memories are being stolen but can't remove the crown from its head except within an antimagic field.</p>
                    <p>After wearing the crown for 1 hour, a creature must succeed on a [[/save ability=int dc=15]] saving throw or be &Reference[condition=stunned] until the crown is removed from its head by someone else. This saving throw is repeated at the end of each hour until either the crown has been removed or its wearer has become &Reference[condition=stunned]. If a creature wears the crown for ten uninterrupted days, the condition becomes permanent, as the crown reduces its wearer to a mindless husk. A @spell[greater restoration] spell or similar magic ends the effect and restores the creature's lost memories.</p>
                    <p>The crown can be destroyed on the <em>anvil of disjunction</em> (@UUID[.0000000000000017#y4.-tower-of-abjuration]{area Y4}). It is otherwise impervious to damage. If the crown is destroyed, the memories it has absorbed flood over all creatures within 10 feet of it.

                <p>Ythryn's elite used this hall for meditation. As someone floated around inside the dome, an illusory image of the person went on with their daily affairs elsewhere in the city.</p>
                <p>The four supporting columns have doors in their bases, which open into shafts that ascend to the dome. The shafts are 60 feet long and lit from above by the shifting auroral light of the dome's interior. A character who steps inside a column levitates up to the dome in 1 round. When a character reaches the dome, read:</p>

                <p>Creatures in the dome gain a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. The corpses of a dozen Netherese apprentices hover around this area, with their hands on their knees and their eyes closed. Characters who adopt this position can meditate by succeeding on a [[/save ability=wis dc=12]] check. While meditating, a character can cast the @spell[project image] spell (save DC <span class="rd__dc">15</span>). The spell lasts for 1 hour, and a character can perform the meditation once per day. To leave the dome, a character must stand at the top of one of the four shafts, to be transported down in a manner similar to how they arrived.</p>

                <p>As Ythryn was about to fall out of the sky, High Transmuter Metaltra used a @spell[true polymorph] spell to transform herself into something she thought would survive the city's destruction: an adamantine statue. An hour later, when the spell should have ended, nothing happened. Through no fault of her own, she had become a statue permanently. Only a @spell[wish] spell can restore her, and then only briefly as she ages centuries in a matter of seconds.</p>
                <p>Characters who climb to the tower's peak find the statue of Metaltra lying in a corner. The statue depicts a woman in a wizard's robe, posed as if she is completing a spell. As her statue was being thrown about during the crash, it damaged part of an inscription on one wall.</p>

Written in Draconic, it reads "Eighth, stand firm in thy circle of death and consume——." The missing word, destroyed by Metaltra's statue, is "poison." Characters who search the room for stone fragments can't find the pieces they need to identify the missing word, but casting a @spell[mending] cantrip on the wall repairs the damage and reconstructs the missing word.

                    <p>On the first successful check, the orchestra launches into a hauntingly beautiful performance. If the next check succeeds, listeners experience a falling sensation in the pits of their stomachs, mirroring Ythryn's downward plunge, as the music reaches a crescendo. If the third and final check succeeds, the conductor brings the piece to a satisfying close as the sound of ghostly applause rises from the audience and phantasmal black roses rain down on the musicians, who face the audience and bow before fading into the afterlife. A character who successfully conducts the orchestra gains inspiration.</p>
                    <p>On each failed check, the spirits become angry, and their antipathy toward the conductor deals 27 ([[/r 5d10]]) psychic damage to each creature in the music hall.</p>

                        <p>Dwellers of the Underdark, phaerimm are malevolent aberrations that are master spellcasters and highly resistant to magic. They use their telepathy to control the weak-minded. They strive to erase all other beings from existence and are known to have caused the collapse of the sarrukh empire of Isstosseffifil. They use their tail stingers to inject their eggs into alien hosts.</p>

                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Iriolarthas and His Apprentices.</span> Characters who proceed farther into the upper floor can see the museum's domed ceiling, which is still intact and a sight to behold. It depicts a powerful mage standing on a balcony of the enclave's central spire, addressing a sea of Netherese citizens below, who stare up at the figure, cheering. This is an image of Iriolarthas at the height of his power, magically preserved in stained glass that glows with its own arcane light. Eight large portraits adorn the walls beneath the dome, depicting Iriolarthas's eight apprentices, known as the Wizards of the Ebon Star. The portraits hang 20 feet above the ground, and a frost-covered plaque is fixed to the wall just beneath each one. The faces in the portraits are depicted as looking up toward their master, Iriolarthas, with expressions of respect. Characters who clear the ice from the plaques can learn their names: High Abjurer Taruth, High Conjurer Damorith, High Diviner Apius, High Necromancer Cadavix, High Evoker Zadulus, High Illusionist Ajamar, High Enchanter Ivira, and High Transmuter Metaltra.</p>

        <p>In this chapter, two wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood attempt to realize their grand ambitions: @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] and @creature[Avarice|IDRotF]. Both are described in @UUID[.0000000000000021#arcane-brotherhood]{appendix C}.</p>
        <p>If the characters are having trouble solving a puzzle in Ythryn, such as how to deactivate the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas, you can use Vellynne or @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] to help them. Both NPCs are highly intelligent and can help the characters arrive at a solution. You, as the DM, can use them to keep the adventure from grinding to a halt.</p>
        <p>Both Vellynne and @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] will do almost anything to obtain Iriolarthas's spellbook, and they are only slightly less determined when it comes time to choose who gets Iriolarthas's @item[staff of power], the @item[scroll of the comet|IDRotF], and the @item[scroll of tarrasque summoning|IDRotF].</p>
        <p>If the characters helped @creature[Dzaan's simulacrum|IDRotF] become a real person in chapter 2 (see "@UUID[.0000000000000012#lost-spire-of-netheril]{Lost Spire of Netheril}"), he might be present as well. Without a full complement of spells, Dzaan isn't nearly as helpful as Vellynne nor as dangerous as @creature[Avarice|IDRotF], but he's just as greedy and self-serving. Roleplay him accordingly.</p>

            <p>@creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] can use her @spell[comprehend languages] spell to translate passages of Draconic script found throughout the necropolis, and her @spell[Leomund's tiny hut] spell conjures an excellent refuge against the extreme cold. She tries to be as useful as possible while staking claim to her fair share of whatever treasure is found in Ythryn. She is particularly interested in magic items, especially those of a wizardly bent (such as Iriolarthas's @item[staff of power]).</p>

                <p>If the characters part ways with Vellynne for any reason, she tries to explore Ythryn alone and contracts the @UUID[.0000000000000017#arcane-blight]{arcane blight}. The next time the characters see her, she is either partially or fully transformed into a nothic.</p>

            <p>@creature[Avarice|IDRotF] (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#arcane-brotherhood]{appendix C}) follows the characters through the Caves of Hunger to Ythryn, killing any NPCs they left behind to guard the caves. The albino tiefling wizard is joined by her two @creature[Gargoyle||gargoyles], her @creature[raven] familiar, twenty @creature[Cult Fanatic||cult fanatics] (members of the Knights of the Black Sword), and ten roped @creature[Mountain Goat|IDRotF|mountain goats] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}) that the cultists use for food and to set off traps. If Huarwar Mulphoon and Fel Suparra are alive, they are among the cult fanatics (see @UUID[.0000000000000004#c6.-gatehouse]{area C6} for more information about these NPCs).</p>
            <p>The Knights of the Black Sword speak Common and Infernal, and they have the following additional trait:</p>
            <div class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Icy Doom" class="rd__b  rd__b--3">
                    <p><span class="entry-title-inner">Icy Doom.</span> When the cultist dies, its corpse freezes for 9 days, during which time it can't be thawed, harmed by fire, animated, or raised from the dead.</p>
                    <p>@creature[Avarice|IDRotF] and her retinue enter the necropolis 12 hours after the party arrives. @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] immediately claims the floating chamber above Skydock Spire (@UUID[.0000000000000017#y28.-skydock-spire]{area Y28}) as her base of operations, using her @spell[fly] spell to reach it, while the cult fanatics encamp around the base of the tower. @creature[Avarice|IDRotF]'s goal is simple: conquer Ythryn and claim its treasures for herself.</p>
                    <p>From her refuge, @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] divides her expedition into four hunting parties of five cult fanatics each, and sends them off to explore the ruins, using her raven familiar and the gargoyles as aerial scouts. The party can meet @creature[Avarice|IDRotF]'s minions anywhere in the necropolis (including inside the spire if the force field surrounding it is deactivated or suppressed). They have orders to attack the characters on sight.</p>
                    <p>Each time the party explores a new building, there is a [[/r 1d100]]{20 percent} chance that one of @creature[Avarice|IDRotF]'s hunting parties is already inside or arrives while the party is searching its interior.</p>

                <p>If she becomes aware of Vellynne's presence in Ythryn, @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] uses her raven familiar to deliver a written invitation to her rival, asking Vellynne to join her inside her floating lair. Vellynne accepts the invitation unless the characters strongly discourage her from doing so. There, @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] coldly lays down her terms: abandon the necropolis within the hour. Conflict between members of the Arcane Brotherhood is forbidden, but @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] makes it clear she is willing to ignore the rules if nobody lives to find out. When Vellynne leaves the meeting, @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] sends her familiar out to spy on her rival and see if her demands are met, which Vellynne has no intention of doing.</p>

                <p>@creature[Avarice|IDRotF] is smart enough to ally with the characters if doing so might help her conquer Ythryn, but she won't join forces as long as @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] is with them—she demands that they cast out her hated rival. If the characters oblige and banish Vellynne from their ranks, @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] reciprocates by sharing [[/r 1d4]] pieces of Ythryn lore she has learned (determine each piece by rolling on the @UUID[.0000000000000017#ythryn-lore]{Ythryn Lore table}).</p>
                <p>Unlike Vellynne, who accompanies the characters, @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] prefers to remain in her glass chamber atop Skydock Spire and stay in touch with the characters remotely by using her @spell[Rary's telepathic bond] spell. Once the characters find all the inscriptions they need to bypass the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas, @creature[Avarice|IDRotF] emerges from her base and accompanies them into the tower, eager to claim the treasures inside.</p>

        <p>The Frostmaiden likes to preserve beauty by freezing it. If the characters failed to defeat Auril in @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000015]{chapter 5}, she takes umbrage with anyone who unseals and plunders the necropolis of Ythryn. After the party has spent one day inside the city, Auril pays Ythryn a visit.</p>
        <p>Please review the information about the Frostmaiden in @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C} before running encounters with her.</p>

            <p>When the Frostmaiden arrives in Ythryn, the temperature throughout the necropolis drops by several degrees. Auril is joined by three @creature[Frost Giant Skeleton|IDRotF|frost giant skeletons] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}), six @creature[Snow Golem|IDRotF|snow golems] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}), and a pack of six @creature[Winter Wolf||winter wolves]. After sending her skeletons, golems, and wolves into the city in small groups to kill interlopers on sight, Auril shuts down the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas by sheer force of her divine will and watches over the city from its high balcony (@UUID[.0000000000000017#y19p.-high-court-balcony]{area Y19p}). The force field remains deactivated until the last of Auril's forms is destroyed or until she leaves the spire.</p>
            <p>Any of @creature[Avarice|IDRotF]'s minions still patrolling the city are swiftly captured and dragged before the Frostmaiden. Auril murders each captive in turn and transforms the cultist into a @creature[coldlight walker|IDRotF] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C}). These undead horrors venture out into the necropolis to hunt down the living.</p>

            <p>If the characters defeat most of Auril's minions, the god's cool voice echoes across the city from the high balcony of the Spire of Iriolarthas, demanding that they leave Ythryn or face her wrath. One hour after making this announcement, Auril leaves the tower and prowls through the streets in search of the characters. For every hour that passes, there is a [[/r 1d100]]{20 percent} chance that she catches up with them. Only characters who flee the city and return to Icewind Dale are spared her wrath.</p>

        <p>Characters who find the @item[scroll of tarrasque summoning|IDRotF] in the Spire of Iriolarthas might be sorely tempted to use it. @item[Professor Skant|IDRotF], an expert on the tarrasque, warns the characters about the uncontrollable nature of the monster and the danger it represents, but the <em>professor orb</em> also confesses that it would love to observe the tarrasque firsthand.</p>
        <p>If summoned in Ythryn, the @creature[tarrasque] destroys everything in sight before smashing its way through the Caves of Hunger and continuing its rampage across Icewind Dale, inevitably putting Ten-Towns in peril. The mountains to the south, the sea to the north and west, and the towering glacier to the east contain the tarrasque for a while. The extreme cold also makes the creature lethargic. It might take months, but the hungry tarrasque eventually makes its way southward through the mountain pass, imperiling the rest of the Sword Coast, if nothing is done to curtail its rampage.</p>
        <p>If summoned on Auril's island, the tarrasque is trapped there by the deep, churning Sea of Moving Ice. The behemoth lays waste to Grimskalle and everything else on the island before sinking into a deep hibernation. Auril, if she survives, is forced to abandon her island lair and find a new refuge.</p>
