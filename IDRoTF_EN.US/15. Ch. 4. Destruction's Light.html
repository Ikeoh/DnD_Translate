    <p>@creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF]'s merciless construct slices through Ten-Towns with its radiant beam.</p>
    <p>Ten-Towns won't survive the attack of Xardorok's dragon without the characters' intervention. This chapter describes the dragon's attacks on Ten-Towns and what the characters can do to minimize the destruction and save as many Ten-Towners as possible. The extent to which they can help depends on their actions in the previous chapter:</p>
    <ul class="rd__list">
        <li class="rd__li ">If the characters delayed their return to Ten-Towns to confront Xardorok in his lair, the amount of time they spent in Xardorok's fortress determines how many Ten-Towns settlements are victimized before the characters can intervene, based on the dragon's timeline.</li>
        <li class="rd__li ">If the characters forgo the attack on Xardorok's fortress and waste no time chasing after the dragon, they have a good chance of catching up to it before too many Ten-Towns settlements are lost.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The point of this chapter, beyond pitting the characters against a formidable draconic foe, is to make the players aware that their characters' choices have consequences. If the characters do nothing to stop the dragon, Ten-Towns will be destroyed. Many lives hang in the balance.</p>

        <p>Review the @creature[Chardalyn Dragon|IDRotF|chardalyn dragon's] stat block and description in @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000021]{appendix C} before running this chapter of the adventure. Stopping the dragon will be a daunting task for the characters. Fortunately, they won't have to fight it alone.</p>
        <p>From the moment it leaves the fortress, the chardalyn dragon begins to carry out Xardorok's plan to level Ten-Towns one settlement after another. The characters can intervene by successfully predicting where the dragon will strike next and confronting it. The "@UUID[.0000000000000014#return-to-ten-towns]{Return to Ten-Towns}" section provides characters with a much-needed ally and a swift dogsled ride back to Ten-Towns. The "@UUID[.0000000000000014#dragon-scourge]{Dragon Scourge}" section describes how long it takes for the dragon to reach each town, the defenses each settlement musters against it, and the likely outcome if no help from the characters is forthcoming. The "@UUID[.0000000000000014#showdown!]{Showdown!}" section helps you run an encounter involving the characters and the dragon. Regardless of what happens to Ten-Towns, the "@UUID[.0000000000000014#vellynnes-quest]{Vellynne's Quest}" section sets up the final three chapters of the adventure.</p>

        <p>As the characters start to make their way back to Ten-Towns, read:</p>
        <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
            <p>Over the sound of the wind, you can hear the barking of dogs getting louder. Through the blowing snow come three wooden sleds pulled by canines as big as wolves. The closest driver calls out, "Can we be of service?"</p>
        </div>
        <p>The figure calling to the party is @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] (see @UUID[.0000000000000021#arcane-brotherhood]{appendix C}), a wizard of the Arcane Brotherhood. She is cocooned in cold weather clothing, her face all but hidden behind a wool muffler. Her snowy @creature[owl] familiar is perched on her shoulder. Her sled has two @creature[Icewind Kobold Zombie|IDRotF|Icewind kobold zombies] riding on it, their acid-eaten forms visible through gashes in their hide armor. Steering the other two sleds are four @creature[Icewind Kobold|IDRotF|Icewind kobolds], two per sled. (See @UUID[.0000000000000021#kobolds]{appendix C} for the kobolds' stat blocks.) Each sled is pulled by six strong dogs (use the @creature[wolf] stat block).</p>
        <p>Vellynne was searching in Ten-Towns for a group of adventurers to help her complete a personal mission when she learned about the characters' earlier acts of bravery (as displayed in @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000001]{chapters 1} and @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000012]{2}). She decided to try to catch up to them and earn their friendship. Although the fate of Ten-Towns doesn't concern her, Vellynne hopes the characters will help her obtain @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF] once they learn to trust her. With this ulterior motive in mind, Vellynne offers the characters her sleds for traveling back to Ten-Towns and can easily be persuaded to help fight the dragon. ("A wizard worth her weight never passes up a chance to test her magic against the mightiest foes," she says brazenly.)</p>
        <p>There's room in the kobolds' sleds to transport the characters and their gear. If the characters insist on steering these sleds, the kobolds fuss about handing over the reins but do so, piling into the cargo beds. If the characters refuse to travel with the kobolds, Vellynne jettisons her little sidekicks without a second thoughtâ€”the characters are much more valuable to her than the kobolds.</p>
        <p>If the characters aren't sure where to go next, Vellynne suggests that they travel to the place where Ten-Towners are most likely to make their final stand against the dragon: the town of Bryn Shander. (Characters who found and studied Xardorok's attack plan in @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000013]{chapter 3} might have a different idea.) If the characters take Vellynne's advice and head to Bryn Shander, they will be playing into Xardorok's hands. The dragon is saving Bryn Shander for last, because Xardorok knows that refugees from the smaller towns have nowhere else to go but there. Bryn Shander's walls provide no defense against the dragon's attacks from the sky, and the closer Ten-Towners huddle together, the easier it becomes for the dragon to annihilate them.</p>

            <p>Vellynne is a pragmatist who tries to stay one step ahead of her competition, in particular her rivals in the Arcane Brotherhood (of whom she rarely speaks). To continue her mission in Icewind Dale, she needs the aid of stalwart adventurers, and she knows that helping them battle the dragon is a golden opportunity to earn the characters' respect if not their trust.</p>
            <p>Vellynne is open about her intentions if the characters are suspicious and confront her. She is willing to postpone her mission until the threat of the dragon is no more, and tells the characters as much.</p>

                <p>By the time the dragon shows up, Bryn Shander is bursting at the seams with refugees from other settlements. This is where Ten-Towns makes its final stand. Although the outer walls offer no defense against the flying dragon, people can hide in the town's root cellars.</p>
                <p>The dragon strafes the town for 6 hours, remaining airborne the whole time and eliminating anyone who tries to get away. It then lands inside the walls and spends another 6 hours going from one smoldering ruin to the next, hunting down survivors. After 12 hours of attacks on Bryn Shander, the dragon returns to @UUID[.0000000000000013#xardoroks-fortress]{Xardorok's fortress} for repairs. (If Xardorok is dead, no repairs are forthcoming, and the dragon remains at the duergar fortress.)</p>
                <p>The Northlook is damaged but not destroyed. Both Blackiron Blades and the House of the Morninglord are lost, along with almost every other establishment.</p>
                <p>While the dragon does its work, @creature[duergar] prowl through town, murdering leaders, spellcasters, and other key figures.</p>

Roughly half of these survivors are Bryn Shander natives; the rest are refugees from other settlements.</p>
                    <p>Scramsax, the proprietor of the Northlook, falls to the dragon. Mishann, the priest of Amaunator, administers healing as best she can and survives without injury.

        <p>The dragon's flying speed is greater than the characters' overland movement speed or the flying speed available to characters who can cast @spell[fly] spells, so the party has little hope of catching up to the dragon before it reaches Ten-Towns. The characters' best chance of destroying the dragon is to pick a settlement and wait for the dragon there. If the characters saw Xardorok's battle plan in the previous chapter, they know the order in which the settlements of Ten-Towns will be attacked.</p>
        <p>The dragon's preferred tactic is to strafe each settlement from the air, using its breath weapon to incinerate people and structures alike. It then soars out of missile range until its breath weapon recharges. After dealing as much damage as it can from the air, the dragon lands and begins searching through the smoldering ruins to eliminate any survivors.</p>
        <p>Whenever the characters engage the dragon, they buy time for Ten-Towners to flee. Reduce a town's losses as you see fit to account for the characters' interference.</p>

            <p>If the characters confront the dragon in Lonelywood, Bremen, Targos, or Bryn Shander, they must also contend with strong wind and heavy snowfall (for rules, see "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,5,strong%20wind,0">Strong Wind</a>" and "<a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,5,heavy%20precipitation,0">Heavy Precipitation</a>" in the <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>).

                <p>During encounters with the dragon, Vellynne can't drop below 1 hit point. If she is reduced to 1 hit point, she either retreats to somewhere safe or uses her next action to cast @spell[vampiric touch], draining the life force of her nearest kobold minion (or some other poor fool) to ensure her own survival.</p>
                <p>Vellynne's most potent spells are useless against the dragon construct, so she relies on her @item[wand of magic missiles], using its charges sparingly. She can also focus her efforts on clearing the streets of innocent bystanders and coordinating the party's actions with those of the local militia. (As she likes to say, "It's a weak wizard who relies on spells alone.")</p>
                <p>After the dragon returns to Xardorok's fortress or is destroyed, Vellynne asks the characters to forget about Ten-Towns for a while and help her find a lost city buried under the Reghed Glacier (see "@UUID[.0000000000000014#vellynnes-quest]{Vellynne's Quest}" at the end of the chapter).</p>
                <p>If you're unable to save Vellynne for whatever reason, have the characters discover a journal in her belongings that contains all the information she knows, or have one of her kobold minions communicate the information necessary to keep the adventure on track.</p>

                <p>A character can rush to the building and use an action to try to pull a Ten-Towner out of the wreckage, doing so with a successful [[/save ability=str dc=14]] (&Reference[skill=Athletics]) check, whereupon the character can try to stabilize a dying commoner or use healing magic to restore their hit points and remove their injuries.</p>

        <p>@creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] needs help reaching @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000017]{Ythryn}, a quest that propels the characters through the final chapters of this adventure. However, she is reluctant to share details of her mission until the following conditions are met:</p>
        <ul class="rd__list">
            <li class="rd__li ">The chardalyn dragon is no longer an immediate concern.</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">The characters have the experience needed to survive the perils that await them in the first stage of the quest. (In other words, the characters are at least 7th level.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These conditions don't account for any unfinished business that the characters are determined to resolve. For example, if @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF] is still alive, the characters might want to finish him off before turning their attention elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Once she's confident that the characters are ready for the challenges that lie ahead, Vellynne makes her bold proposition:</p>
        <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
            <p>"I need your help to find an ancient city buried under the ice. This city, Ythryn, is a lost fragment of the Empire of Netheril, whose wizards created many of the magic items we find scattered across the world today. It holds magic beyond our wildest dreams. We might even find something there to end this hateful winter. Intrigued?"</p>
        </div>
        <p>If characters want to hear more or leave an opening for Vellynne to keep talking, she adds:</p>
        <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
            <p>"Using divination magic, the Arcane Brotherhood has learned that the city is buried deep inside the Reghed Glacier. But the glacier can be cracked open at a place where a waterfall once flowed down its side but has since frozen. We have already found the waterfall. All we need now is the magic to break open the glacier."</p>
        </div>
        <p>Vellynne learned a few things from her @item[professor orb|WDMM] (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000022]{appendix D}) before it was stolen from her. She shares the following information with characters who want to know more about Netheril:</p>
        <ul class="rd__list">
            <li class="rd__li ">Netheril was a vast human empire ruled by wizards, whose mastery of the Weave remains unsurpassed to this day.</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">Some of what the Netherese wizards learned came from the elves. The rest came from the study of artifacts called the <em>Nether Scrolls</em>.</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">The Netherese created magic that was more powerful than a @spell[wish] spell and used it to accomplish the impossible. Their magic could shear the tops of mountains and lift entire cities into the sky.</li>
            <li class="rd__li ">To hold Ythryn aloft, the Netherese wizards would have needed a powerful magic item called a @item[Ythryn Mythallar|IDRotF|mythallar]. It likely survived the crash and might have other properties as well, including the ability to change the weather. ("Think of what that could mean for Icewind Dale!" Vellynne adds excitedly.)</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <div class="rd__wrp-image relative">

            <p>Before beginning their search for Ythryn, Vellynne and the characters need two objects: @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF] and Vellynne's @item[professor orb|WDMM], which she calls @item[Professor Skant|IDRotF]. Vellynne has every reason to believe that both items are currently on an island in the Sea of Moving Ice.</p>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="The Codicil" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1016"><span class="entry-title-inner">The Codicil</span></h3>
                <p>Vellynne describes this book as follows:</p>
                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                    <p>"Written and guarded by Auril's followers, @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF] is rumored to contain a spell or ritual that can carve a passage through the Reghed Glacier, under which the lost city Ythryn is buried. Divination magic has revealed that the book is being held in a frost giant fortress on a mist-shrouded island in the Sea of Moving Ice."</p>
                </div>
                <p>Vellynne knows that any quest to retrieve @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF] is likely to attract Auril's attention. Members of the Arcane Brotherhood are notoriously brazen, which is why Vellynne does not balk at the thought of a confrontation with the Frostmaiden. If Auril's name comes up, Vellynne tries to allay concerns by pointing out the obvious: "Any god who chooses to live among mortals is hiding from something, and anyone who needs to hide can't be all-powerful."</p>
            </div>
            <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Professor Skant" class="rd__b  rd__b--2">
                <h3 class="rd__h rd__h--2" data-title-index="1017"><span class="entry-title-inner">Professor Skant</span></h3>
                <p>Vellynne's family has a private collection of magic items. The @item[professor orb|WDMM] known as @item[Professor Skant|IDRotF] was part of that collection, and Vellynne wants it back for both practical and sentimental reasons:</p>
                <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                    <p>"The orb is a family heirloom that was stolen from me by a former colleague named Nass Lantomir. The orb has the personality of a scholar and is named Professor Skant. Its knowledge will help us once we descend into Ythryn. Nass is after <em>The Codicil of White</em>. Find Nass, and we find Professor Skant."</p>
                </div>
                <p>Vellynne describes the <em>professor orb</em>'s properties (see @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000022]{appendix D}) if the characters want to know more about it.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Next Steps" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="1018"><span class="entry-title-inner">Next Steps</span></h2>
            <p>The rest of the adventure depends on the characters agreeing to help Vellynne. She has a couple of cards that she plays to convince the characters to do so. She hopes they're motivated by the hope of finding something in Ythryn that can end Auril's everlasting winter. Failing that, there's the promise of finding long-lost spells and magic items.</p>
            <p>Assuming the characters agree to undertake Vellynne's quest, their first challenge is getting to the island. Proceed with @UUID[JournalEntry.bGFHJOs6yQKK0dQn.JournalEntryPage.0000000000000015]{chapter 5}, which begins with how the characters solve their transportation problem.</p>
