    <p>The white, snow-covered slopes of Kelvin's Cairn loom large behind this quiet lakeside town. Caer-Konig started as a camp for a group of mountaineers from the northern Moonsea region. As the camp grew, a wooden palisade was added to discourage raiders. Later came the stone castle of Caer-Konig. Alas, neither the palisade nor the castle fared well; both fell to orcs before falling into ruin.</p>
    <p>Caer-Konig as it is known today consists of terraced rows of houses that recede from the shore of Lac Dinneshere like the tiers of an amphitheater. The harbor is frozen, its docks skewed and broken by the shifting ice. Buried under the snow on the slopes above the last row of houses are the ruins of the Caer that gave the town its name—a reminder to the people of Caer-Konig that nothing lasts in this corner of the world.</p>
    <p>Travel to and from this remote town was expedited by the ferry that ran out of Easthaven, but with the ferry shut down, Caer-Konig is completely cut off by mountains, lake, and snow. Forced to live on what they can haul out of the iced-over lake, the people of Caer-Konig are bitter and angry. They believe that the rest of Ten-Towns has abandoned them. The only thing that keeps the townsfolk from leaving is the beer at the local tavern, which never seems to run out.</p>
    <p>As if things weren't bad enough, the town has suffered several mysterious break-ins recently, with no evidence of the intruders except dwarven boot tracks in the snow leading north. Since there are no known settlements in that direction, the townsfolk assume that Auril's everlasting winter has taken its toll on the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn, forcing them to come down from the mountain in search of food or beer. In truth, the town is beset by &Reference[condition=invisible] duergar searching for chardalyn.</p>
    <p>The town speaker, a heavy-drinking dragonborn named Trovus, patrols at night to keep an eye out for trouble. In his inebriated state, however, Trovus is prone to wandering out onto the icy lake or passing out on the ramshackle docks, and he almost never remembers his nightly patrols once his head clears.</p>

            <p><em>Tavern</em></p>
            <p>This tavern owes its popularity to the free half-pints of ale that the proprietor, Eglendar "Glen" Korr (neutral good half-elf @creature[commoner]), keeps on the table by the front door. He presses one into the hand of every person who stops by (the hook), which compels most of them to stay to order seconds and thirds (the line). The "sinker" part of the tavern's name refers both to the last drink call of the night and—when locals challenge visitors to a drinking contest—to the last drink that sends a losing contestant under the table.</p>
            <p>Glen gets his ale from the dwarves who live in the valley at the foot of Kelvin's Cairn, and he pays Jarthra the dwarf (see "Frozenfar Expeditions" below) to fetch it for him.</p>

            <p><em>Adventuring outfitter</em></p>
            <p>Run by a seasoned ranger named Atenas Swift (neutral good human @creature[scout]), this shop sells adventuring gear. Attached to the shop is a locked wooden shed where Atenas stores a pair of dogsleds and a kennel where he keeps a dozen healthy sled dogs (use the @creature[wolf] stat block to represent them). Six dogs are enough to pull each sled. Helping Atenas run the shop is an experienced mountain guide named Jarthra Farzassh (lawful good shield dwarf @creature[scout]). The two have an excellent rapport, mixed with some competitive ribbing.</p>
            <p>Age has caught up with Atenas. He can feel the cold in his joints and ventures out less frequently than he once did. Nowadays, he prefers to stay indoors while offering Jarthra's services as a wilderness guide.</p>

            <p><em>Inn</em></p>
            <p>The inn gets its name from a magic lantern that once hung above the front door. An &Reference[condition=invisible] duergar stole it recently, depriving the establishment of some of its charm.</p>
            <p>The inn is kept by the Shorard sisters (neutral good human @creature[Commoner||commoners]). The younger, Allie, is lithe and charming; she greets guests and does all the cleaning. The older, Cori, is stout and scowling; she sees to the inn's provisioning and handles all the cooking. The sisters cast baleful glances at one another and bicker behind closed doors, but nothing ever comes of their feuds, as evidenced by the fact that they've been running the inn together for more than a decade.</p>

        <p>The characters can pick up this quest if they start the adventure in Caer-Konig or when they arrive in town. It begins as the characters enter the quiet village, which is being tormented by &Reference[condition=invisible] thieves.</p>
        <p>Led by @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF]'s younger son, Nildar, &Reference[condition=invisible] duergar are searching Caer-Konig for chardalyn, bringing whatever interesting things they find back to their outpost on the side of Kelvin's Cairn. It's up to the characters whether they help the people of Caer-Konig restore their stolen valuables, or confront the duergar for their own personal gain.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="220"><span class="entry-title-inner">Getting the Quest</span></h2>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                <p>The town sits quietly at the foot of Kelvin's Cairn. A few bundled-up people shuffle between snow-battered houses, keeping their heads down, barely bothering to give you a look as you walk past them.</p>
                <p>A pile of snow stirs as you pass it, and someone hidden beneath it suddenly stands. The figure looks around and yells, "Who goes there? Is it thieves? Have I found those creeping bastards?"</p>
                <p>When he pulls down the scarf covering his face, you see it is a silver dragonborn holding onto an empty wine bottle as if it was a weapon. He belches, grins at you, and says, "Pardon my manners. Bit jittery with all the thieving going on. I'm Trovus, the town speaker."</p>
            </div>
            <p>Trovus (neutral good silver dragonborn @creature[veteran]) spends most of his days drinking and reminiscing about his bygone adventuring days. He's been patrolling at night looking for thieves, but after yet another night of heavy drinking, he passed out in the snow after a few hours. He has no recollection of how he ended up in the snow pile or why he was outside drinking in the first place.</p>
            <p>If he's asked about the thieves, Trovus takes a deep breath, trying to suppress his hiccups, before explaining the situation:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                <p>"The town has had some thievery troubles. No one's seen anything, really. Just the other night, the lantern over at the Northern Light was stolen. Cori won't let me hear the end of it because I haven't been able to find those responsible. Not yet, anyway. But I have a knack for this stuff."</p>
            </div>
            <p>If he's not stopped, Trovus starts a long speech about the adventures he went on in his younger days. His stories include one where he kicked a half-ogre into a river and watched it float away while it yelled profanities at him. Another tells of the time he tricked a group of kobolds into believing he was a dragon in humanoid form.</p>
            <p>If the characters ask about the missing lantern, he offers to take them to the local inn so they can talk to the Shorard sisters, who run the establishment. He seems less bothered by the cold than anyone else in the settlement, due to his silver dragon heritage. As they walk, Trovus talks about what has been taken from Caer-Konig over the past three nights:</p>
            <ul class="rd__list">
                <li class="rd__li ">A color-switching magic lantern, taken from the local inn</li>
                <li class="rd__li ">A pair of goats, stolen from the local tavern</li>
                <li class="rd__li ">A small sack of pearls carved into decorative beads, gone missing from the stores of Frozenfar Expeditions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the characters inquire about a reward for dealing with the thieves, Trovus explains that the town doesn't have the coin to pay someone to investigate the matter. Most of the valuables in the village have disappeared already, so there's little left to use as compensation.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-roll-name-ancestor="Helpful Sisters" class="rd__b  rd__b--1">
            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="221"><span class="entry-title-inner">Helpful Sisters</span></h2>
            <p>Trovus leads the characters through Caer-Konig to the Northern Light on the eastern edge of town. An empty hook, meant to carry a lantern, hangs above the inn's entrance.</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                <p>The inn appears to be mostly empty. A young woman looks up as you enter, gives Trovus a chastising smile, and says, "Did you fall asleep outside again? I'm telling you, Trovus, one day you're going to have to stop relying on the kindness of strangers."</p>
                <p>The woman then opens a door into what looks like a kitchen and calls out, "Heat up something for Trovus. He's been out 'patrolling' again."</p>
            </div>
            <p>The woman, Allie, is one of the Shorard sisters (neutral good human @creature[Commoner||commoners]), who own the inn. The other owner, Cori, is working in the kitchen. Allie settles Trovus into a chair before approaching the characters.</p>
            <p>She confirms that the town has been experiencing break-ins and robberies lately, but no one has witnessed a potential culprit. The only clue is a set of tracks leading in the direction of Kelvin's Cairn. Allie thinks the tracks were made by dwarves who live in the valley at the base of Kelvin's Cairn. She suspects that the endless winter has made the dwarves desperate for food and ale, though she can't explain why the dwarves would steal the inn's lantern and other valuables. Allie is also surprised that no one in Caer-Konig has seen or heard the dwarves, remarking that "A quiet dwarf is an oxymoron."</p>
            <p>Any interaction with Allie is interrupted when Cori exits the kitchen:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                <p>The door to the kitchen swings open as a stern-looking woman enters holding a steaming bowl of soup. She places the bowl down in front of Trovus and says, "No dwarf did this. Someone would have spotted 'em. Caught 'em. No, there's something more going on. Besides, what use do hungry dwarves have for a lantern?"</p>
            </div>
            <p>If the characters ask Cori for details, she explains that the magic lantern that used to decorate the outside of their inn doesn't do anything useful other than light up the area with different colors.</p>
            <p>If asked about a reward for dealing with the thieves, the sisters say they have little coin, but they can provide food and comfortable beds in exchange for the party's help. They'll even throw in a few flagons of beer if the characters can bring their magic lantern back to the inn.</p>
            <p>If the characters accept the quest, Allie takes them to the back of the inn, where faint footprints lead toward Kelvin's Cairn. If they refuse the quest, Caer-Konig continues to be tormented by &Reference[condition=invisible] thieves until the duergar stop searching the town for chardalyn.</p>

                <p>If the characters are interested in following the suspicious tracks, the Shorard sisters suggest they visit Frozenfar Expeditions and secure a dogsled before setting out on their adventure. If the characters do so, they discover that Jarthra, the mountain guide at Frozenfar Expeditions, is willing to accompany the characters for a small fee of 10 gp per day of travel. Jarthra has advantage on Wisdom (&Reference[skill=Survival]) checks made in the vicinity of Kelvin's Cairn.</p>

            <h2 class="rd__h rd__h--1" data-title-index="223"><span class="entry-title-inner">Following the Tracks</span></h2>
            <p>The tracks leading away from the inn have been partly filled with blowing snow, making them appear as small depressions. Once the characters get about 50 feet away from the inn and its outbuildings, they discover that the tracks have been completely obscured.</p>
            <p>If the characters wait until morning to set out, they find a set of fresh footprints left behind by a lone duergar scout. This duergar didn't enter any buildings, but simply looked around the village before leaving close to morning. Following the footprints leads to a different set of tracks, which were made by an ogre zombie pulling a dogsled. These new tracks begin where the duergar tracks end, a quarter-mile outside of town. (The ogre zombie waited all night for the duergar to return. The duergar hopped onto the dogsled before ordering the ogre zombie to march.) Any character who examines these tracks and succeeds on a [[/save ability=wis dc=15]] (&Reference[skill=Survival]) check identifies the creature tracks as belonging to an ogre. The characters can follow these fresh tracks, which head toward the mountain and then veer toward the duergar outpost hidden in the northeastern foothills of Kelvin's Cairn.</p>
            <p>Once the characters get within a mile of the outpost, they discover that the wind has erased the tracks they've been following, making it difficult for them to find the exact destination. For every hour the characters spend searching the foothills, have them make a [[/save ability=wis dc=15]] (&Reference[skill=Survival]) group check. Jarthra contributes to this group check, if she's present, and has advantage on her roll. If the group check succeeds, the characters find the outpost. If the group check fails, they didn't find the outpost during that hour but can try again. If they fail two of these group checks in a row, the characters have a random encounter in the wilderness, possibly during a blizzard (see "@UUID[.0000000000000012#running-wilderness-encounters]{Wilderness Encounters}").</p>

            <p>The duergar outpost, a recent addition to the foothills north of Kelvin's Cairn, was carved out of a hillside. Although the duergar are based mainly in Xardorok's mountain fortress (described in chapter 3), they come to this outpost to resupply and rest before searching nearby settlements for chardalyn.</p>
            <p>When the characters find the duergar outpost, read:</p>
            <div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud">
                <p>A blocky stronghold bereft of warmth or charm juts out of a hillside in a rough crescent shape. Only part of its construction is visible; the rest is buried in the stone.</p>
                <p>A large double door of stone serves as the main entrance. The terrain leading to it is a gently upward-sloping plain covered with fresh snow. A stream used to flow out of a barred culvert northeast of the main entrance, but the waterway has frozen. Two other barred openings can be seen along the stronghold's northern wall. Anyone positioned behind these openings would have an unobstructed view of the hillside.</p>
                <p>Closer to you, separated from the rest of the stronghold, is a snow-covered stone bunker perforated by arrow slits.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Two duergar watch for approaching intruders. One is stationed in the bunker (@UUID[.0000000000000005#o1.-bunker]{area O1}), the other in the overlook (@UUID[.0000000000000005#o3.-overlook]{area O3}). These duergar are tired and bored, but they notice characters who are so incautious as to carry light sources or otherwise announce their presence.</p>
            <p>If the overlook duergar sees what she perceives to be a threat, she sounds the alarm as she runs down to the main entrance (@UUID[.0000000000000005#o2.-main-keep]{area O2}) to pull up the drawbridge, taking 2 rounds to do so. The duergar in the bunker is armed with a heavy crossbow ([[/r 1d10]] piercing damage) and takes pot shots at visible threats.</p>
            <p>Characters who succeed on a [[/save ability=dex dc=10]] (&Reference[skill=Stealth]) check can approach the stronghold undetected by hugging the north cliff and moving behind the bunker and below the openings of the overlook. Once they reach the mouth of the frozen river, they can crawl through the culvert (which leads under area O2) or quietly approach the main entrance without being detected.</p>

                <p>When the characters arrive, the outpost contains five @creature[duergar] (including Nildar), who behave as described here.</p>
                <p>Before entering combat, these duergar use their Enlarge trait to increase their size. If a duergar is caught alone by a group of foes, it calls out for help before turning &Reference[condition=invisible]. When backup arrives, it uses its Enlarge and rejoins the fight.</p>
                <p>These duergar won't negotiate, and they refuse to surrender. If the characters capture and interrogate a duergar, a successful [[/save ability=cha dc=14]] (&Reference[skill=Intimidation]) check can convince the prisoner to divulge the following information:</p>
                <ul class="rd__list">
                    <li class="rd__li ">Nildar Sunblight commands the outpost.</li>

                    <li class="rd__li ">The outpost was built close to Kelvin's Cairn for a reason. Once Ten-Towns is destroyed, the duergar plan to use this outpost as a staging area for a raid against the mines in the Dwarven Valley.</li>

            <p>The duergar outpost was not built with the intention of being aesthetically pleasing or welcoming to strangers. There is no interior lighting, since the duergar rely on &Reference[rule=darkvision] to see.

                <p>Each of the northern rooms has one @creature[duergar] sleeping in it. The two duergar are brothers named Ruvik and Skorn. If the characters move around without making any loud noises, the duergar stay asleep. If awakened, they attack the intruders. The duergar sleep in their armor, keeping their shields and weapons within reach.</p>

One small sack holds the stolen valuables from Caer-Konig: twenty-five pearls carved into decorative beads (5 gp each). Another sack contains three @item[Dagger|PHB|daggers], a set of @item[woodcarver's tools|PHB], a set of @item[navigator's tools|PHB], @item[fishing tackle|PHB], and a @item[potion of healing] hidden in a leather pouch along with 73 sp.</p>

            <p>When the characters return to the Northern Light, they find Trovus passed out in a padded armchair while Allie and Cori go about their work. If the characters tell Allie about the duergar outpost, she admits to knowing nothing about duergar and is disturbed to learn that they can turn &Reference[condition=invisible] and grow themselves to ogre size!</p>
            <p>If the characters retrieved the inn's lantern, Allie offers them a few flagons of ale as a reward. She has prepared rooms for them, even if they didn't bring back the lantern. Allie can also help the characters return other stolen goods to their proper owners in Caer-Konig.</p>
